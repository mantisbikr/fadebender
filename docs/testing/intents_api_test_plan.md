# Intents API Live Testing Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-15 (Updated with Letter-Based API)
**Tester:** _____________
**Live Version:** _____________

## ðŸ†• NEW: Letter-Based API

**This test plan now uses the improved letter-based API for sends and returns!**

- âœ… **Tracks:** Still use `track_index: 1` for Track 1 (1-based, matches Live UI)
- âœ… **Sends:** Use `send_ref: "A"` for Send A (instead of `send_index: 0`)
- âœ… **Returns:** Use `return_ref: "A"` for Return A (instead of `return_index: 0`)

**Why letter-based?**
- Matches how Live displays sends and returns (Send A, Return B, etc.)
- More intuitive for natural language commands
- Easier to read and understand

**Legacy numeric API still works** but letter-based is preferred.

---

## Setup Requirements
- [ ] Ableton Live running
- [ ] Server running on port 8722 (`cd server && make dev-returns`)
- [ ] At least 3 audio tracks in Live set
- [ ] At least 2 return tracks (Return A, Return B)
- [ ] Return A has a Reverb device (for device tests)

---

## Test Format
- **Display Values:** Use human-readable values (e.g., `-6` for -6dB, `20` for 20% right pan)
- **Pass Criteria:** Mark `y` if the value in Live matches expected, `n` if wrong, `skip` if cannot test
- **Notes:** Add any observations in the Notes column

## PART 14: REVERB DEPENDENT PARAMETERS (AUTO-ENABLE MASTERS)

These tests verify that dependent parameters (e.g., Chorus Rate/Amount, ER Spin Rate/Amount, Shelves/Filters) either:
- auto-enable their master toggle (e.g., "Chorus On") before applying the dependent, or
- in dry_run mode, preview a `pre` operation indicating auto-enable will occur.

Assumptions
- Return A (`return_ref:"A"`) has a Reverb instance at `device_index: 0`.
- Parameter names below use substring matching (`param_ref`) and may vary slightly per Live version.
- For readback verification, numeric `return_index` is 0 for Return A.

Helper: Verify current device params (readback)
- `curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8722/return/device/params?index=0&device=0" | jq`
  - Find `"Chorus On"`, `"ER Spin On"`, `"LowShelf On"`, `"HiShelf On"`, `"HiFilter On"` and their dependents.

    - Expect: `preview.pre.note == "auto_enable_master"` if Freeze On is off.
  - Execute:
    - `curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8722/intent/execute -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"domain":"device","action":"set","return_ref":"A","device_index":0,"param_ref":"Flat On","value":1,"unit":"on"}' | jq`

Verification after each dependent write (non-dry-run)
- `curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8722/return/device/params?index=0&device=0" | jq`
  - Confirm the relevant master toggle (e.g., "Chorus On") now has `value` near its max and the dependent reflects the target display.

Notes
- If params_meta.fit is missing for a numeric display parameter, non-dry-run will converge approximately via readback; dry_run will show an `approx_preview_no_fit` note.
- If a dependent name differs (e.g., "High Shelf" vs "HiShelf"), adjust `param_ref` substring accordingly.

### Notes:
- All curl commands use `http://127.0.0.1:8722` - adjust if your server is on a different port
- Copy each curl command into your terminal and press Enter
- Check Live immediately after running each command
- Mark `y` for pass, `n` for fail, `skip` if you can't test it

### Quick Tips:
- **Pan values:** Use `-50` for 50L, `50` for 50R, `0` for center
- **Mute/Solo:** Use `1` for on, `0` for off
- **Sends:** Remember they max at `0 dB`, not `+6 dB`
- **1-based indexing:** Track 1 = first track, Return 1 = Return A
