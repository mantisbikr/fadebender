Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a comprehensive architecture + design document you can drop into VS Code for ChatGPT (or Claude/Cursor) to read and use for implementation of Fadebender‚Äôs agentic system.

üß† Fadebender Agentic Architecture Specification

Version: Draft 1.0
Owner: Fadebender Engineering
Purpose: Define the agent-based architecture, routing logic, data flow, and storage policies for Fadebender‚Äôs conversational AI layer that interprets and executes natural-language commands within Ableton Live.

‚∏ª

1. Overview

Fadebender‚Äôs intelligence layer is agentic ‚Äî a modular architecture where a single orchestrator agent (router) coordinates specialized sub-agents or tools to fulfill user intents.
All interaction occurs inside a single unified web chat; users see one assistant capable of control, advice, help, and Q&A.

The goal is to enable users to talk naturally (‚Äúmake the vocals brighter‚Äù) while the system converts requests into safe, precise Ableton Live actions and, when needed, gives audio-engineering advice or help information.

2. Core Agents

2.1 Orchestrator (Router)

Role: Entry point for every user message.
Responsibilities
	‚Ä¢	Classify incoming text into one or more tracks:
	1.	Direct Control ‚Äì change parameters in Live
	2.	Mix Advice / Set Analysis ‚Äì analyze the Live Set and suggest improvements
	3.	Live Q&A ‚Äì answer questions from the Ableton manual
	4.	Fadebender Help ‚Äì answer usage questions about Fadebender itself
	‚Ä¢	Maintain shared session context (live_set_id, current_track, current_device, snapshot_id)
	‚Ä¢	Call appropriate sub-agents (tools) and merge their outputs into a unified chat reply

2.2 Intent Normalizer

Role: Convert messy natural-language requests into strict machine-safe JSON ‚Äúintents.‚Äù
Input: free-text command
Output: normalized intent object
Duties
	‚Ä¢	Spell/typo repair (Levenshtein + synonym tables)
	‚Ä¢	Unit parsing (ms‚Üîbeats, dB‚Üîlinear)
	‚Ä¢	Mapping synonyms ‚Üí param IDs via Firestore
	‚Ä¢	Apply parameter scaling (linear, log, exp)
	‚Ä¢	Clamp to safe min/max ranges
	‚Ä¢	Emit canonical JSON v1.2

2.3 Executor

Role: Send normalized intents to Ableton Live through Remote Script or OSC bridge.
Returns: result object (ok/error, actual value, undo token).
Behavior: write-through to in-memory snapshot after success; append intent log to Firestore.

2.4 Set Inspector

Role: Maintain an in-memory snapshot of the Live Set (updated every 60 s).
Captures
	‚Ä¢	Track/return/master structure
	‚Ä¢	Devices, parameters, mix values, sends, routing
	‚Ä¢	Meter data (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Live Set hash for change detection
Provides
	‚Ä¢	Quick lookups for Orchestrator and Advisor
	‚Ä¢	Diff API for change detection

2.5 Mix Advisor

Role: Analyze the current snapshot and propose improvement ‚Äúcards.‚Äù
Each card: {title, why, intents[]}
Example: ‚ÄúVocal Presence Boost ‚Äì cut guitar 2 kHz by 2 dB, reduce reverb send 3 dB.‚Äù
Advisor never executes changes directly; user must confirm or click ‚ÄúApply.‚Äù

2.6 Live Q&A Agent

Role: Retrieve explanations from indexed Ableton Live 12 manual using RAG.
Sources: Local markdown KB chunks with section titles and parameter tables.
Output: Concise, cited answers.

2.7 Fadebender Help Agent

Role: Retrieve product usage information (‚Äúhow to save snapshots,‚Äù ‚Äúundo behavior‚Äù).
Sources: Fadebender documentation KB.

3. Unified Chat Architecture

All agents operate behind a single chat endpoint.

Session Context

  "live_set_hash": "3b91...",
  "current_track": "Lead Vox",
  "current_device": "Reverb(0)",

  "ephemeral": false,
  "created_at": "2025-10-21T21:02:00Z"
}

4. Chat Scoping & User Experience

4.1 Chat Scopes

Type	When	Scope	Retention
Live-Set Chat	Default when a set is open	live_set_id bound	intent logs 24‚Äì72 h
Scratchpad Chat	For general questions, no set	unscoped	ephemeral
Duplicate Chat	For A/B experiments	same set + new session_id	same TTL
Ephemeral Chat	Privacy mode	any	auto-delete on close

4.2 UI Behavior
	‚Ä¢	New Chat button ‚Üí prompt:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúStart new chat for current Live Set‚Äù (default)
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúScratchpad (no set)‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúDuplicate current chat‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Title example: ‚ÄúMy Song v5 ‚Äì Vocal Polish (Oct 21)‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	In-chat utilities:
	‚Ä¢	Reset Context
	‚Ä¢	Save Snapshot
	‚Ä¢	Undo Last

‚∏ª

5. Data Persistence & Storage Rules

5.1 Snapshots
	‚Ä¢	Full Live Set snapshot in memory, refreshed ‚âà 60 s.
	‚Ä¢	Do not write every snapshot to Firestore.
	‚Ä¢	Persist only:
	‚Ä¢	latest pointer (doc)
	‚Ä¢	Manual snapshot packs ‚Üí compressed JSON in GCS (.json.gz)
	‚Ä¢	Diffs ‚Üí small Firestore docs (before/after, path, snapshot_id)

5.2 Intent Logs
	‚Ä¢	Persist every write-intent (atomic per param).
	‚Ä¢	TTL = 24‚Äì72 h (default).
	‚Ä¢	Retain manual snapshots indefinitely.
	‚Ä¢	For analytics, export nightly to BigQuery.

5.3 Manual Snapshot Pack Schema

{
  "schema": "set_snapshot.v1",
  "header": {
    "snapshot_id": "snap_abc",
    "name": "Chorus Lift v2",
    "scope": "track:Lead Vox",
    "tags": ["chorus","vocals"],
    "captured_at": "...",
    "live_set_hash": "3b91...",
    "gcs_uri": "gs://fadebender/..."
  },
  "payload": { /* scoped track/device params */ }
}


‚∏ª

6. Safety and Undo
	‚Ä¢	Clip guard: max ¬±3 dB per intent
	‚Ä¢	Wet/dry delta cap: ¬±15 %
	‚Ä¢	All writes generate an undo_token (stores before value)
	‚Ä¢	/undo/{undo_token} endpoint restores prior state
	‚Ä¢	Conflicts resolved by comparing live_set_hash
	‚Ä¢	Multi-intent ‚Äúcards‚Äù logged as a parent command with child intents

‚∏ª

7. APIs / Endpoints (illustrative)

Method	Path	Purpose
POST	/route	Router entry point
POST	/normalize	NLP ‚Üí strict intent
POST	/execute	Apply normalized intents
GET	/set/snapshot	Return current Live Set snapshot
POST	/advice	Generate mix advice cards
POST	/qa/live	Live manual Q&A
POST	/qa/fadebender	Product help
POST	/snapshots/save	Manual snapshot pack
POST	/snapshots/{id}/diff	Diff vs current state
POST	/snapshots/{id}/apply	Apply stored snapshot
POST	/undo/{token}	Undo last change


‚∏ª

8. Session Lifecycle & Retention

Phase	Action	Retention
Active	in-memory snapshot + logs	live
Grace window	after ended_at	24‚Äì72 h (default TTL)
Expired	auto-purge intents; keep manual snapshots	archived
Exported	optional user export (.zip)	user-controlled


‚∏ª

9. Implementation Phases

Phase	Deliverable	Key Focus
P1	Router + Intent Normalizer + Executor	reliable control path
P2	Set Inspector (snapshot) + Mix Advisor	advice generation
P3	RAG (Q&A + Help) + multi-chat UI	knowledge & support
P4	Manual Snapshots + Diff + Undo	state management
P5	Analytics + BigQuery exports	evaluation, telemetry

10. Example Intent JSON v1.2

{
  "v": "1.2",
  "action": "set_param",
  "target": {
    "scope": "return",
    "track_name": "Return A",
    "device": {"name": "Reverb", "ordinal": 0},
    "param": {"id": "predelay", "name": "Pre-Delay"}
  },
  "value": {"raw": 0.2, "unit": "s", "scaled": 0.37},
  "safety": {"clip_guard": true, "max_delta": 0.15},
  "snapshot_id": "snap_92",
  "explain": "Increase pre-delay to add separation before reflections."
}


‚∏ª

11. Future Extensions
	‚Ä¢	Multi-agent graph execution (parallel Mix Advisor + Genre Advisor)
	‚Ä¢	External plugin mapping ingestion (VST/AU metadata)
	‚Ä¢	Offline mix-evaluation pipeline (LUFS + masking analysis)
	‚Ä¢	Auto-learning of new device parameter scales via telemetry
	‚Ä¢	Realtime ‚ÄúLive Meter Agent‚Äù for dynamic loudness control

‚∏ª

12. Key Design Principles
	1.	Single chat, many brains ‚Äì one user experience, multiple specialized agents behind the curtain.
	2.	Safety first ‚Äì guard all writes, always log before/after.
	3.	Context isolation ‚Äì new goals ‚Üí new chat.
	4.	Ephemeral by default ‚Äì session logs auto-expire; manual saves are explicit.
	5.	Explain every change ‚Äì LLM replies must include a rationale users can learn from.
	6.	Extensible tools ‚Äì add new skills without changing UI or router schema.

Implementation note

In VS Code, feed this document into your chat-based coder (ChatGPT or Claude) as context.
Then ask:

‚ÄúImplement the Orchestrator and Intent Normalizer per section 2 and 7 of the Fadebender Agentic Architecture Spec.‚Äù

That will produce the correct FastAPI service scaffolding, Pydantic models, and router logic following this design.
