# Universal Audio Engineering Principles

## Frequency Spectrum Knowledge

### Sub-Bass (20-60Hz)
- **Content**: Kick drum fundamentals, bass guitar lowest octave
- **Mixing**: High-pass everything else, mono for phase coherence
- **Feeling**: More felt than heard, adds weight and power

### Bass (60-200Hz)
- **Content**: Bass guitar body, kick drum punch, piano low end
- **Problems**: Muddiness, room resonances, bass buildup
- **Techniques**: Cut here to tighten, boost for warmth

### Low-Mids (200-500Hz)
- **Content**: Vocal/instrument body, guitar power chords
- **Problems**: Boxiness, muddiness in dense mixes
- **Techniques**: Often needs cutting, careful with boosts

### Mids (500Hz-2kHz)
- **Content**: Vocal presence, guitar mids, snare body
- **Importance**: Critical for intelligibility and forward presence
- **Techniques**: Boost for presence, cut for smoothness

### High-Mids (2-8kHz)
- **Content**: Vocal consonants, instrument attack, clarity
- **Problems**: Harshness, sibilance, ear fatigue
- **Techniques**: Boost for clarity, cut for smoothness

### Highs (8kHz+)
- **Content**: Air, sparkle, cymbal shimmer
- **Effect**: Adds openness and brightness
- **Techniques**: Gentle boosts, avoid over-brightening

## Compression Fundamentals

### Universal Compression Principles
- **Threshold**: Where compression begins (-20dB to -6dB typical)
- **Ratio**: Compression strength (2:1 gentle, 6:1+ aggressive)
- **Attack**: Transient control (fast = more control, slow = preserve punch)
- **Release**: Return to normal (fast = transparent, slow = smooth)

### Instrument-Specific Compression
**Vocals:**
- Ratio: 3:1 to 6:1
- Attack: Medium (3-10ms) to preserve natural onset
- Release: Fast to medium for transparency
- Goal: Consistency without losing dynamics

**Drums:**
- Kick: Fast attack (0.1-1ms), 4:1 ratio, control low-end
- Snare: Medium attack (1-3ms), 3:1 ratio, enhance crack
- Overheads: Slow attack, light ratio, preserve transients

**Bass:**
- Slow attack to preserve note attack
- Medium release to control sustain
- Moderate ratio (2:1-4:1) for consistency

### Compression for Musical Effect
- **Parallel Compression**: Blend compressed and dry signals
- **Side-Chain Compression**: External trigger (kick pumping bass)
- **Multiband Compression**: Frequency-specific control

## Reverb and Spatial Effects

### Reverb Types and Applications
**Room Reverb:**
- Natural, intimate space
- Short decay (0.5-1.5 seconds)
- Use: Vocals, acoustic instruments

**Hall Reverb:**
- Large, spacious environment
- Medium to long decay (2-4 seconds)
- Use: Orchestral, cinematic, vocals

**Plate Reverb:**
- Vintage, dense character
- Controlled decay, bright tone
- Use: Vocals, drums (vintage sound)

**Spring Reverb:**
- Surf/rockabilly character
- Distinctive "boing" quality
- Use: Guitars, vintage effects

### Reverb Parameters
- **Pre-delay**: Gap before reverb (0-100ms)
- **Decay Time**: How long reverb lasts
- **High/Low Damping**: Frequency-specific decay control
- **Wet/Dry Mix**: Balance of effect vs. original signal

### Spatial Positioning
**Panning Guidelines:**
- Lead vocals: Center
- Bass: Center to slight left
- Kick/Snare: Center
- Hi-hats: 30-45° right (drummer's perspective)
- Guitars: Wide spread (±30-70°)

**Depth Creation:**
- Close: Dry signal with minimal reverb
- Medium: Balanced wet/dry reverb
- Far: High reverb, filtered highs

## EQ Principles and Techniques

### EQ Types
**Parametric EQ:**
- Precise frequency and Q control
- Best for surgical cuts and musical boosts
- Most versatile for mixing

**Graphic EQ:**
- Fixed frequency bands
- Good for room correction
- Less precise than parametric

**Shelving EQ:**
- Affects all frequencies above/below cutoff
- Gentle, musical curves
- Good for tonal shaping

### EQ Techniques
**Subtractive EQ:**
- Cut problem frequencies first
- More natural than boosting
- Reduces phase issues

**Additive EQ:**
- Boost desired frequencies
- Use sparingly and musically
- Can create phase problems

**High-Pass Filtering:**
- Remove unnecessary low frequencies
- Reduces muddiness and conflicts
- Start around 80-100Hz for most instruments

## Mixing Workflow Principles

### Gain Staging
- Maintain proper levels throughout signal chain
- Peak around -18dBFS for analog modeling plugins
- Leave headroom for processing and mastering

### Signal Flow Order
1. **High-Pass Filter**: Remove unwanted lows
2. **Corrective EQ**: Fix problems
3. **Dynamics**: Compression, gating
4. **Musical EQ**: Enhance desired characteristics
5. **Color/Character**: Saturation, distortion
6. **Time-Based Effects**: Reverb, delay
7. **Stereo Processing**: Width, panning

### Reference and Context
- A/B compare with reference tracks
- Check mix on multiple monitoring systems
- Take breaks to reset ear fatigue
- Use spectrum analysis but trust your ears

## Stereo Imaging and Width

### Stereo Width Techniques
**Natural Width:**
- Panning instruments across stereo field
- Use room mics and overheads
- Avoid extreme processing

**Enhanced Width:**
- Stereo widening plugins
- Haas effect (short delays)
- Mid/Side processing

### Phase Considerations
- Check mono compatibility regularly
- Be careful with stereo widening
- Use correlation meters when available
- Avoid phase cancellation in low frequencies

## Common Problem Solving

### Muddiness
- High-pass aggressive filters on non-bass instruments
- Cut low-mids (200-500Hz) where buildup occurs
- Use side-chain compression to duck competing elements

### Harshness
- Cut high-mids (2-5kHz) where harshness resides
- Use de-esser on sibilant sources
- Check for digital distortion and clipping

### Lack of Punch
- Enhance transients with compression
- Boost attack frequencies (60-80Hz kick, 2-5kHz snare)
- Use parallel compression for power

### Mix Translation
- Check on multiple playback systems
- Verify mono compatibility
- Use reference tracks in similar genre
- Trust calibrated monitoring environment
