# Chat Interface Integration for Version Control

## Natural Language Commands for Version Control

### Undo/Redo Commands
```
BASIC UNDO:
"undo" | "undo that" | "undo last change" | "go back"
→ Reverts the most recent parameter change

SPECIFIC UNDO:
"undo the reverb change" | "undo track 2 volume" | "undo the last 3 changes"
→ Reverts specific parameters or multiple changes

TIME-BASED UNDO:
"go back 5 minutes" | "restore to how it was 10 minutes ago" | "undo everything from the last hour"
→ Reverts to a specific point in time

REDO COMMANDS:
"redo" | "redo that change" | "bring back the reverb increase"
→ Re-applies previously undone changes
```

### Snapshot Management
```
CREATE SNAPSHOTS:
"save snapshot" | "create snapshot called 'rough mix'" | "take a picture of this"
→ Creates named or automatic snapshots

"save this as 'before vocals'" | "snapshot this state" | "bookmark this mix"
→ Creates named snapshots with descriptions

RESTORE SNAPSHOTS:
"restore 'rough mix'" | "go back to 'before vocals'" | "load snapshot 'mix-v2'"
→ Restores to specific named snapshots

"restore to 2 hours ago" | "go back to this morning's mix"
→ Restores to time-based snapshots
```

### History Queries
```
RECENT CHANGES:
"what did I just do?" | "what changed?" | "show me recent changes"
→ Displays last few changes with details

"what did I change in the last 10 minutes?" | "show today's changes"
→ Time-filtered change history

PARAMETER-SPECIFIC HISTORY:
"show me all volume changes" | "track 2 reverb history" | "what compression changes did I make?"
→ Filtered by parameter type or track

COMPARISON QUERIES:
"what's different since 'rough mix'?" | "compare to snapshot 'before vocals'"
→ Shows state differences between current and snapshot
```

### Advanced Versioning Queries
```
WORKFLOW ANALYSIS:
"what improved the mix most?" | "which changes made it sound better?"
→ AI analysis of positive changes based on user feedback

PROJECT PROGRESSION:
"show me the mix timeline" | "how did this song evolve?" | "what's the change summary?"
→ Overview of major milestones and changes

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
"what do I usually do after adding reverb?" | "show my mixing patterns"
→ Analysis of user's typical workflows and habits
```

## Integration with Audio Engineering Advice

### Context-Aware Suggestions
When providing audio engineering advice, the system can reference the user's history:

```
User: "I want more punch in my drums"
System: "For drum punch, I see you previously increased compression on Track 3 (drums)
2 hours ago and it improved the sound. You could try:
1. Increase compression ratio from 3:1 to 4:1
2. Boost 60-80Hz for more weight
3. Add parallel compression

Would you like me to increase the compression, or shall I create a snapshot first
so you can easily go back?"
```

### Smart Workflow Integration
```
BEFORE MAJOR CHANGES:
User: "add heavy compression to everything"
System: "This will make significant changes to your mix. Should I create a snapshot
first so you can easily return to the current state?"

AFTER EXPERIMENTS:
User: "that sounds worse"
System: "I can undo the heavy compression changes. Would you like me to:
1. Undo just the compression (last 4 changes)
2. Restore to the snapshot 'before-compression-experiment'
3. Gradually reduce the compression instead?"

LEARNING FROM HISTORY:
User: "how do I get that vocal sound from yesterday?"
System: "Yesterday you achieved great vocal sound with:
- ChromaVerb Vocal Hall (25% wet)
- Gentle compression (3:1 ratio)
- High boost at 10kHz (+2dB)
Would you like me to apply these settings to the current vocal track?"
```

## Enhanced System Prompt Integration

### Versioning-Aware Responses
The AI should be trained to:

1. **Suggest Snapshots**: Before major changes or experiments
2. **Reference History**: Use past successful changes as examples
3. **Offer Comparisons**: "This is similar to what you did yesterday on Track 2"
4. **Enable Safe Experimentation**: "Let's try this - you can always undo it"

### Example Enhanced Responses
```
ORIGINAL RESPONSE:
"For vocal spaciousness, try ChromaVerb Synth Hall (15-25% wet).
You can say: 'add reverb to track 2'"

VERSIONING-ENHANCED RESPONSE:
"For vocal spaciousness, try ChromaVerb Synth Hall (15-25% wet).
I notice you used this successfully on Track 1 yesterday.
Should I create a snapshot first so you can A/B test the difference?
You can say: 'add reverb to track 2'"
```

## Database Schema for Chat Integration

### Extended Change History
```sql
-- Add chat context to change tracking
ALTER TABLE change_history ADD COLUMN chat_context JSONB;

-- Example chat_context:
{
  "user_query": "I want more punch in my drums",
  "ai_suggestion": "Try increasing compression ratio to 4:1",
  "user_confirmation": "yes, do it",
  "related_advice": "drum_punch_compression",
  "confidence_score": 0.95
}
```

### User Learning Patterns
```sql
-- Track user preferences and successful changes
CREATE TABLE user_patterns (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_session UUID,
    pattern_type VARCHAR(100), -- "vocal_processing", "drum_mixing", etc.
    successful_changes JSONB,
    unsuccessful_changes JSONB,
    user_feedback JSONB,
    frequency_count INTEGER,
    last_used TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Snapshot Metadata for Chat
```sql
-- Enhanced snapshot metadata for better chat queries
ALTER TABLE snapshots ADD COLUMN chat_metadata JSONB;

-- Example chat_metadata:
{
  "user_description": "This is the rough mix before I started working on vocals",
  "milestone_type": "vocal_processing_start",
  "user_satisfaction": "good",
  "tags": ["rough_mix", "pre_vocals", "drums_done"],
  "project_phase": "mixing"
}
```

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Basic Versioning (Current Sprint)
- [x] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Basic undo/redo for single parameter changes
- [ ] Simple snapshot creation and restoration
- [ ] Chat command parsing for version control

### Phase 2: Enhanced History (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Time-based queries ("what changed in last 10 minutes")
- [ ] Parameter-specific history ("show volume changes")
- [ ] Comparison between states
- [ ] Integration with audio engineering advice

### Phase 3: Smart Learning (Future)
- [ ] Pattern recognition in user workflows
- [ ] Success/failure tracking of changes
- [ ] Personalized recommendations based on history
- [ ] Advanced timeline visualization

### Phase 4: Collaboration Features (Future)
- [ ] Shared snapshots between users
- [ ] Collaborative change tracking
- [ ] Project handoffs with complete history
- [ ] Team mixing workflows

## Benefits Summary
