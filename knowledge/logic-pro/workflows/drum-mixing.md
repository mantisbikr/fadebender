# Logic Pro Drum Mixing Workflows

## Drum Punch and Impact

### Multipressor for Drums
**Kick Drum Processing:**
- Low band (20-80Hz): Heavy compression for consistent low-end
- Low-mid band (80-200Hz): Medium compression for punch
- Attack: Fast to control transients, Release: Medium

**Snare Drum Processing:**
- Mid band (200Hz-2kHz): Light compression for body
- High-mid band (2-8kHz): Medium compression for crack and presence
- Preserve natural attack while controlling sustain

**Commands:**
- "add compression to track X"
- "increase track X punch"
- "compress kick drum on track X"

### Vintage EQ for Character
**Kick Drum EQ:**
- Boost at 60-80Hz for weight and power
- Slight cut at 200-400Hz to reduce muddiness
- Boost at 2-5kHz for attack and beater definition

**Snare Drum EQ:**
- High-pass at 80-100Hz to remove low-end rumble
- Boost at 200Hz for body and fullness
- Boost at 3-5kHz for crack and presence
- Gentle boost at 10kHz+ for sparkle

**Commands:**
- "boost track X lows by 3dB"
- "boost track X at 3kHz"
- "add presence to track X"

## Drum Dynamics and Control

### Compressor (Standard)
**Individual Drum Settings:**
- **Kick**: 4:1 ratio, fast attack, medium release
- **Snare**: 3:1 ratio, medium attack, fast release
- **Toms**: 2:1 ratio, slow attack, medium release
- **Overheads**: Light compression for glue, slow attack

### Noise Gate
**Tom and Snare Gating:**
- Threshold set just above bleed level
- Fast attack to preserve transients
- Medium release to maintain natural decay

**Commands:**
- "gate track X"
- "reduce bleed on track X"

## Drum Stereo Imaging

### Direction Mixer
**Drum Kit Positioning:**
- Kick and snare: Center position
- Hi-hats: Slight right (drummer's perspective)
- Toms: Spread across stereo field
- Overheads: Full stereo width

### Stereo Spread
**Width Enhancement:**
- Use stereo spread on overhead mics
- Careful not to create phase issues
- Maintain mono compatibility

**Commands:**
- "pan track X right by 30%"
- "center track X"
- "widen track X stereo image"

## Drum Effects and Character

### Tape Delay for Groove
**Rhythmic Enhancement:**
- 1/16 note delays on snare for groove
- Low feedback (5-15%) for subtle effect
- High-frequency damping for vintage character

### ChromaVerb for Ambience
**Room Sounds:**
- Room presets for natural drum ambience
- Short decay times to avoid muddiness
- Side-chain compression to duck reverb during hits

**Commands:**
- "add room reverb to track X"
- "add tape delay to track X"
- "increase drum ambience"
