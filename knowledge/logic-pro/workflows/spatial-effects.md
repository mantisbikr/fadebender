# Logic Pro Spatial Effects and Positioning

## Stereo Positioning and Panning

### Direction Mixer
**Precise Positioning:**
- Angle control for exact placement in stereo field
- Distance control for depth perception
- LFE (Low Frequency Effects) routing for sub content

**Common Positions:**
- Lead vocals: Center (0°)
- Bass: Center to slight left (-10° to 0°)
- Kick: Center (0°)
- Snare: Center (0°)
- Hi-hats: Right side (30-45°)
- Guitar leads: Left or right (±30-60°)
- Rhythm guitars: Wide spread (±70-90°)

**Commands:**
- "pan track X left by 30%"
- "pan track X right by 45%"
- "center track X"
- "position track X to the right"

### Stereo Spread
**Width Enhancement:**
- Increase stereo width of overhead mics
- Widen background vocals for chorus effect
- Use sparingly to avoid phase issues

**Commands:**
- "widen track X"
- "increase track X stereo width"

## Depth and Space Creation

### ChromaVerb Spatial Presets
**Depth Layers:**
- **Vocal Hall**: Medium depth, natural decay
- **Synth Hall**: Large space, long decay
- **Room**: Close, intimate space
- **Plate**: Vintage character, controlled decay

**Wet/Dry Balance:**
- Close sounds: 10-20% wet signal
- Medium depth: 20-35% wet signal
- Distant sounds: 35-50% wet signal

### Space Designer Impulse Responses
**Room Characteristics:**
- Small rooms: Intimate, controlled reflections
- Large halls: Expansive, long decay times
- Plates: Vintage reverb character
- Springs: Classic surf/rockabilly sound

**Commands:**
- "add reverb to track X"
- "increase reverb on track X by 15%"
- "add hall reverb to track X"
- "make track X sound distant"

## Delay Effects for Space

### Tape Delay
**Spatial Enhancement:**
- Short delays (20-40ms): Doubling effect, thickness
- Medium delays (80-150ms): Slap-back echo
- Long delays (200ms+): Rhythmic echoes

**Feedback Settings:**
- 0-20%: Subtle enhancement
- 20-40%: Noticeable echo
- 40%+: Sustained echoes (use carefully)

### Echo Plugin
**Modern Delay Effects:**
- Ping-pong delays for wide stereo effects
- Filtered delays for frequency-specific echoes
- Modulated delays for chorus-like width

**Commands:**
- "add delay to track X"
- "add ping-pong delay to track X"
- "increase delay feedback on track X"

## Advanced Spatial Techniques

### Binaural Post-Processing
**3D Audio Effects:**
- HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function) processing
- Creates convincing 3D positioning in headphones
- Use for special effects and immersive experiences

### Surround Panner
**Multi-Channel Positioning:**
- 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound positioning
- Precise speaker placement control
- Rotation and movement automation

**Commands:**
- "move track X around the room"
- "place track X behind listener"

## Frequency-Based Spatial Effects

### Channel EQ for Distance
**Distance Simulation:**
- High-frequency roll-off for distant sounds
- Low-mid cut for thin, far-away character
- Presence boost for close, intimate sounds

### Multipressor Spatial Processing
**Frequency-Specific Reverb:**
- Send only high frequencies to reverb
- Keep low-end dry for clarity
- Create natural distance effects

**Commands:**
- "make track X sound far away"
- "bring track X closer"
- "add distance to track X"
