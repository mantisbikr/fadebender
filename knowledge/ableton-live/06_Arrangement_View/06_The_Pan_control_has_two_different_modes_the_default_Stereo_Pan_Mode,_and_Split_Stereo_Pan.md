# 6 The Pan control has two different modes: the default Stereo Pan Mode, and Split Stereo Pan

6.

The Pan control has two different modes: the default Stereo Pan Mode, and Split Stereo Pan
Mode. In Stereo Pan Mode, the Pan control positions the track’s output in the stereo field. To
reset the Pan control to center, click on its associated triangle. In Split Stereo Pan Mode, the
sliders let you adjust the position of the track’s left and right input channels separately. Double-
click on the sliders to reset them. You can switch between the two pan modes via the Pan
control’s context menu. With multiple tracks selected, adjusting the pan knob for one of them
will adjust the others as well.
To mute the track’s output, turn off the Track Activator switch. With multiple tracks selected,
toggling one of their Track Activators will toggle the others as well.
Clicking the Solo switch (or pressing the S shortcut key) solos the track by muting all other
tracks, but can also be used for cueing. With multiple tracks selected, pressing any of their Solo
switches will solo all of them. Otherwise, tracks can only be soloed one at a time unless the
Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier is held down or the Exclusive Solo option in the Record,
Warp & Launch Settings is deactivated.
If the Arm Recording button is on, the track is record-enabled. With multiple tracks selected,
pressing any of their Arm switches will arm all of them. Otherwise, tracks can only be armed
one at a time unless the Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier is held down or the Exclusive
Arm option in the Record, Warp & Launch Settings is deactivated. With Exclusive Arm enabled,
inserting an instrument into a new or empty MIDI track will automatically arm the track.

18.1.1 Additional Mixer Features

Additional Mixer Possibilities.

The Mixer section has several additional features that are not visible by default. The mixer is resizable,
and dragging upwards on the top of the mixer will extend the height of the track meters, adding tick
marks, a numeric volume field and resettable peak level indicators. Increasing a track’s width in this
state will add a decibel scale alongside the meter’s tick marks.

These enhancements are tailored for use in traditional mixing settings, but are available anytime the
Mixer section is displayed.

Because of the enormous headroom of Live’s 32-bit floating point audio engine, Live’s audio and
MIDI tracks can be driven far “into the red“ without causing the signals to clip. The only time that
signals over 0 dB will be problematic is when audio leaves Live and goes into the outside world.
Examples include:

•
•
•

When routing to or from physical inputs and outputs, like those of your sound card.
Audio on the Main track (which is almost always connected to a physical output).
When saving or exporting audio to a file.

Nevertheless, Live provides this optional visual feedback for signals that travel beyond 0 dB in any
track.

18.2 Audio and MIDI Tracks

Audio and MIDI tracks in Live are for hosting and playing clips, as explained in the Live Concepts
chapter.

You can add new audio and MIDI tracks to your Live Set by using the corresponding Create menu
commands, or you can use the shortcuts Ctrl
T (Mac) to create an audio
track and Ctrl

T (Mac) to create a MIDI track.

T (Win) / Cmd

T (Win) / Cmd

Shift

Shift

Tracks can also be created by double-clicking or pressing Enter on files in the browser to load
them, or by dragging contents from the browser into the space to the right of Session View tracks or
below Arrangement View tracks. Devices or files loaded into Live in this manner will create tracks of
the appropriate type (e.g., a MIDI track will be created if a MIDI file or effect is dragged in).

Dragging one or multiple clips from an existing track into the space to the right of Session View tracks
or below Arrangement View tracks creates a new track with those clips and the original track’s
devices.

A track is represented by its track title bar.

Tracks are Represented by Track Title Bars.

You can click on a track title bar to select the track and then execute an Edit menu command on the
track to edit it. One such available command is Rename. One can quickly rename a series of tracks
R (Mac), and then
by executing this command, or the Rename shortcut Ctrl
using the Tab key to move from title bar to title bar.

R (Win) / Cmd

When a # symbol precedes a name, the track will get a number that updates automatically when the
track is moved. Adding additional # symbols will prepend the track number with additional zeros. You
can also enter your own info text for a track via the Edit Info Text command in the Edit menu or in the
track’s context menu.

You can drag tracks by their title bars to rearrange them, or click and drag on their edges to change
their width (in the Session View) or height (in the Arrangement View).

Multiple adjacent or nonadjacent tracks can be selected at once by Shift -clicking or
Ctrl -clicking, respectively. If you drag a selection of nonadjacent tracks, they will be collapsed
together when dropped. To move nonadjacent tracks without collapsing, use Ctrl + arrow keys
instead of the mouse.

When multiple tracks are selected, adjusting one of their mixer controls will adjust the same control for
the other tracks. If the tracks in the multi-selection have differing values for any particular knob or
slider parameter (volume, for example), this difference will be maintained as you adjust the
parameter.

If you drag a track’s title bar to a folder in the Places section of the browser it will be saved as a new
Set. If a track contains audio clips, Live will manage the copying of the referenced samples into this
new location based on the selection in the Collect Files on Export chooser. You can then type in a
name for the newly created Set or confirm the one suggested by Live with Enter .

Tracks are deleted using the Edit menu’s Delete command.

18.3 Group Tracks

You can combine any number of individual audio or MIDI tracks into a special kind of summing
container called a Group Track. To create a Group Track, select the tracks to include and execute the
Edit menu’s Group Tracks command. You also use this command to nest an existing Group Track(s)
within a new Group Track.

Group Tracks themselves cannot contain clips, but they are similar to audio tracks in that they have
mixer controls and can host audio effects.

Group Tracks also provide a quick way to create submixes. When tracks are placed into a group,
their Audio To routing choosers are automatically assigned to their Group Track unless they already
had a custom routing, i.e. to a destination other than Main. You can also use a Group Track purely as
a “folder“ track by rerouting the outputs of the contained tracks to some other destination.

The tracks in a group can be shown or hidden via the Unfold Group button in the title bar. This can
help you to organize large Sets by hiding away tracks that you don’t need to see.

An Unfolded Group Track in Session View.

Once a Group Track has been created, tracks can be dragged into or out of the group. Deleting a
Group Track deletes all of its contents, but a group can be reverted back into individual tracks by
executing the Edit Menu’s Ungroup Tracks command.

Group Tracks in Arrangement View show an overview of the clips in the contained tracks.

A Folded Group Track in Arrangement View

In Session View, slots in Group Tracks have launch and stop buttons whenever at least one clip is
available in a given scene. Launching or stopping this button has the same effect as launching or
stopping all contained clips. Likewise, selecting a Group Slot serves as a shortcut for selecting all of
the contained clips.

To apply a Group Track’s color to all of its contained tracks and clips, you can use the Assign Track
Color to Grouped Tracks and Clips command in the respective Group Track header’s context menu.

Note that when using the Assign Track Color to Grouped Tracks and Clips command in Session View,
the color change will only affect Session clips. Likewise, using either command in Arrangement View
will only change the color of Arrangement clips.

If a Group Track contains a soloed track or nested Group Track, its Solo button will appear half
colored.

18.4 Return Tracks and the Main track

In addition to Group Tracks and tracks that play clips, a Live Set has a Main track and return tracks;
these cannot play clips, but allow for more flexible signal processing and routing.

The return tracks and the Main track occupy the right-hand side of the Session mixer view and the
bottom end of the Arrangement View.

Note that you can hide and show the return tracks using the Return Tracks entry in the Mixer Controls
submenu within the View menu.

Like regular clip tracks, return tracks can host effects devices. However, whereas a clip track’s effect
processes only the audio within that track, return tracks can process audio sent to them from numerous
tracks.

For example, suppose you want to create rhythmic echoes with a delay effect. If you drag the effect
into a clip track, only clips playing in this track will be echoed. Placing this effect in a return track lets it
receive audio from any number of tracks and add echoes to them.

The Send Controls and Pre/Post Toggles.

A clip or group track’s Send control determines how much of the track’s output feeds the associated
return track’s input. What’s more, even the return track’s own output can be routed to its input, allowing
you to create feedback. Because runaway feedback can boost the level dramatically and
unexpectedly, the Send controls in Return tracks are disabled by default. To enable them, right-click
on a Return track’s Send knob and select Enable Send or Enable All Sends.

Every return track has a Pre/Post toggle that determines if the signal a clip track sends to it is tapped
before or after the mixer stage (i.e., the pan, volume and track-active controls). The “Pre“ setting
allows you to create an auxiliary mix that is processed in the return track, independently of the main
mix. As the return track can be routed to a separate output, this can be used to set up a separate
monitor mix for an individual musician in a band.

The Main track is the default destination for the signals from all other tracks. Drag effects here to
process the mixed signal before it goes to the Main output. Effects in the Main track usually provide
mastering-related functions, such as compression and/or EQ.

You can create multiple return tracks using the Create menu’s Insert Return Track command, but by
definition, there is only one Main track.

18.5 Using Live’s Crossfader

Live includes a crossfader that can create smooth transitions between clips playing on different tracks.
Live’s crossfader works like a typical DJ-mixer crossfader, except that it allows crossfading not only
two, but any number of tracks — including the returns.

The Crossfader.

The crossfader can be accessed via the Mixer Controls submenu in the View menu or the menu
options in the mixer view control at the bottom right of Live’s window. Seven different crossfade curves
are available so that you can choose the one that fits your style the best. To change the curve, right-
click on the crossfader, then select an entry from the context menu.

Choose from Seven Crossfader Curves.

The chart below details the power level and response of each crossfader curve.

Crossfader Curve Properties.

The crossfader can be mapped to any continuous MIDI controller (absolute or incremental). In
addition to the crossfader’s central slider, its absolute left and right positions are separately available
for MIDI or keyboard mapping. There are two special scenarios for remote control with respect to the
crossfader:

•

•

A key mapped to any one of the three assignable crossfader positions (left, center or right) will
toggle the crossfader’s absolute left and right positions.
Mapping to two of the three fields allows for a “snapping back“ behavior when one of the
assigned keys is held down and the other is pressed and released.

Crossfade Assign Buttons.

Each track has two Crossfade Assign buttons, A and B. The track can have three states with respect to
the crossfader:

•
•

•

If neither Assign button is on, the crossfader does not affect the track at all.
If A is on, the track will be played unattenuated as long as the crossfader is in the left half of its
value range. As the crossfader moves toward the right across the center position, the track fades
out. At the crossfader’s rightmost position, the track is muted.
Likewise, if B is on, the track’s volume will be affected only as the crossfader moves left across
its center position.

It is important to understand that the Crossfade Assign buttons do not affect the signal routing; the
crossfader merely influences the signal volume at each track’s gain stage. The track can be routed to
an individual output bus regardless of its crossfade assignment. In studio parlance, you can think of
the crossfader as an on-the-fly VCA group.

As with almost everything in Live, your crossfading maneuvers can be recorded into the Arrangement
for later in-depth editing. To edit each track’s crossfade assignment, please choose “Mixer“ from the
Envelope Device chooser and “X-Fade Assign“ from the Control chooser. The crossfader’s automation
curve is accessible when “Mixer“ is chosen from the Main track’s Device chooser and “Crossfade“ is
selected from its Control chooser.

18.6 Soloing and Cueing

By default, soloing a track simply mutes all other tracks (except in some cases where tracks are
feeding other tracks). The signal from the soloed tracks is heard through their respective outputs, with
the pan setting of each track preserved. Soloing a clip track leaves any return tracks audible,
provided that the Solo in Place option is enabled in the Solo button’s context menu. Solo in Place can
also be set as the default behavior by selecting the entry in the Options menu.

Soloing a return track mutes the main output of all other tracks, but still allows you to hear any signals
that arrive at the return via track sends.

Live allows you to replace the standard soloing operation with a cueing operation that lets you
preview tracks as though you were cueing a record on a DJ mixer. This allows choosing clips and
adjusting effects without the audience hearing, before bringing tracks into the mix.

In order to set Live up for cueing, you must be using an audio interface with at least four dedicated
outputs (or two dedicated stereo outputs). The respective settings are accessible in the Main track.
Make sure you have the mixer section and In/Out controls visible.

The Cueing-Related Session Mixer Controls.

5.

The Main Out chooser selects the output on your interface to be used as the main output.
The Cue Out chooser selects the output on your hardware interface to be used for cueing. This
has to be set to an output other than that selected for Main. If the desired outputs don’t show up
in these choosers, please check the Audio Settings.
Activate cueing by setting the Solo/Cue Mode switch to “Cue.“
The tracks’ Solo switches are now replaced by Cue switches with headphone icons. When a
track’s Cue switch is pressed, that track’s output signal will be heard through the output selected
in the Cue Out chooser. Note that the Track Activator switch on the same track still controls
whether or not the track is heard at the Main output.
The Cue Volume control adjusts the volume of the cueing output.

Note that when cueing is set up and activated, the output of audio files that you are previewing in the
browser is also heard through the Cue Out.

18.7 Track Delays

A Track Delay control is available for every track in Live. The control allows delaying or pre-delaying
the output of tracks in milliseconds in order to compensate for human, acoustic, hardware and other
real-world delays.

You can access Track Delays using the Track Options entry in the Mixer Controls submenu within the
View menu, or the menu options in the mixer view control at the bottom right of Live’s window.

The Track Delay Control and Selector.

We do not recommend changing track delays on stage, as it could result in undesirable clicks or pops
in the audio signal. Micro-offsets in Session View clips can be achieved using the Nudge Backward/
Forward buttons in the Clip View, however track delays can be used in the Arrangement View for such
offsets.

Note that delay compensation for plug-ins and Live devices is a separate feature, and is automatic by
default. Unusually high Track Delay settings or reported latencies from plug-ins may cause noticeable
sluggishness in the software. If you are having latency-related difficulties while recording and playing
back instruments, you may want to try turning off device delay compensation, however this is not
normally recommended. You may also find that adjusting the individual track delays is useful in these
cases. Note that the Track Delay controls are unavailable when device delay compensation is
deactivated.

18.8 Keep Monitoring Latency in Recording Track

Toggles

When monitoring is set to “In” or “Auto,” the “Keep Monitoring Latency in Recording” option will be
enabled by default.

The Keep Latency in Recording Track Toggles.

This adjusts the timing of the recording to match what is heard through Live’s monitoring. Generally
speaking it is recommended to leave this option enabled when recording software instruments or
effects, and to switch it off when recording acoustic instruments or relying on external monitoring.

You can use the toggles or right-click on the In or Auto track monitor buttons to manually switch “Keep
Monitoring Latency in Recorded Audio” on or off.

18.9 Performance Impact Track Indicators

In the mixer section, it is possible to see each track’s impact on the CPU load using the Performance
Impact indicators. You can show or hide the indicators using the Mixer Controls submenu in the View
menu or the menu options in the mixer view control at the bottom right of Live’s window.

The Performance Impact Indicators.

Each track has its own CPU meter with six rectangles that light up to indicate the relative impact of that
track on the CPU level of the current Set. Freezing the track with the largest impact or removing
devices from that track will usually reduce the CPU load.

19. Recording New Clips

This chapter is about recording new clips from audio and MIDI input signals. Note that this is a
different kind of recording than the capturing of Session clips into the Arrangement.

For successful audio recording, please make sure the audio settings are set up properly. For more on
this, please see the built-in program lesson on setting up Audio Settings. Also, keep in mind that
devices such as microphones, guitars and turntables do not operate at line level, meaning that they
will need to have their levels boosted before they can be recorded. For these devices, you must
therefore use either an audio interface with a preamp, or an external preamp.

On MIDI tracks, it is possible to “capture” played material after you’ve played it, without the need to
press the Record button beforehand. This allows for more freedom and flexibility when you want to
improvise or experiment. For more information, please refer to the Capturing MIDI section.

19.1 Choosing an Input

A track will record whatever input source is shown in its In/Out section, which appears when the View
menu’s In/Out option is checked. In the Arrangement View, unfold and resize the track in order to
completely see the In/Out section.

The Track In/Out Section in the Arrangement (Left) and Session View (Right).

Audio tracks default to recording a mono signal from external input 1 or 2. MIDI tracks default to
recording all MIDI that is coming in through the active external input devices. The computer keyboard
can be activated as a pseudo-MIDI input device, allowing you to record MIDI even if no MIDI
controller hardware is currently available.

For every track, you can choose an input source other than the default: any mono or stereo external
input, a specific MIDI channel from a specific MIDI-in device or a signal coming from another track.
The Routing and I/O chapter describes these options in detail.

19.2 Arming (Record-Enabling) Tracks

Track Arm Buttons in the Arrangement (Left) and Session (Right) Mixers.

To select a track for recording, click on its Arm button. It doesn’t matter if you click a track’s Arm button
in the Session View or in the Arrangement View, since the two share the same set of tracks.

By default, armed tracks are monitored, meaning that their input is passed through their device chain
and to the output, so that you can listen to what is being recorded. This behavior is called “auto-
monitoring“ and you can change it to fit your needs.

If you are using a natively supported control surface, arming a MIDI track will automatically lock this
control surface to the instrument in the track.

Clicking one track’s Arm button unarms all other tracks unless the Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac)
modifier is held. If multiple tracks are selected, clicking one of their Arm buttons will arm the other
tracks as well. Arming a track selects the track so you can readily access its devices in the Device
View.

19.3 Recording

Recording can be done in both the Session and the Arrangement Views. If you want to record onto
more than one track simultaneously and/or prefer viewing the recording linearly and in-progress, the
Arrangement View may be the better choice. If you want to break your recording seamlessly into
multiple clips or record while you are also launching clips in Live, use the Session View.

19.3.1 Recording Into the Arrangement

Pressing the Control Bar’s Arrangement Record button starts recording. The specific behavior
depends on the state of the “Start Playback with Record” button in the Record, Warp & Launch
Settings. When enabled, recording starts as soon as the button is pressed. When disabled,
recording will not start until the Play button is pressed or Session clips are launched. Regardless
of the state of this preference, holding Shift while pressing Arrangement Record will engage
the opposite behavior.
Recording creates new clips in all tracks that have their Arm button on.
When MIDI Arrangement Overdub is enabled, new MIDI clips contain a mix of the signal
already in the track and the new input signal. Note that overdubbing only applies to MIDI
tracks.
To prevent recording prior to a punch-in point, activate the Punch-In switch. This is useful for
protecting the parts of a track that you do not want to record over and allows you to set up a
pre-roll or “warm-up“ time. The punch-in point is identical to the Arrangement Loop’s start
position.
Likewise, to prevent recording after the punch-out point, activate the Punch-Out switch. The
punch-out point is identical to the Arrangement Loop’s end position.
When you are recording into the Arrangement Loop, Live retains the audio recorded during
each pass.

You can later “unroll“ a loop recording, either by repeatedly using the Edit menu’s Undo command or
graphically in the Clip View: After loop recording, double-click on the new clip. In the Clip View’s
Sample Editor, you can see a long sample containing all audio recorded during the loop-recording
process. The Clip View’s loop brace defines the audio taken in the last pass; moving the markers left
lets you audition the audio from previous passes.

19.3.2 Recording Into Session Slots

You can record new clips, on the fly, into any Session slots.

Set the Global Quantization chooser to any value other than “None“ to obtain correctly cut
clips.
Activate the Arm button for the tracks onto which you want to record. Clip Record buttons will
appear in the empty slots of the armed tracks.
Click the Session Record button to record into the selected scene in all armed tracks. A new clip
will appear in each clip slot, with a red Clip Launch button that shows it is currently recording.
To go from recording immediately into loop playback, press the Session Record button again.
Alternatively, you can click on any of the Clip Record buttons to record into that slot. To go from
recording immediately into loop playback, press the clip’s Launch button.
To stop a clip entirely, press its Clip Stop button or the Stop button in the Control Bar.

It is possible to stop playback and prepare for a new “take” with the New button. The New button
stops clips in all armed tracks and selects a scene where new clips can be recorded, creating a new
scene if necessary. Note that the New button is only available in Key Map Mode and MIDI Map
Mode. Detailed steps for creating keyboard assignments are available in the Computer Keyboard
Remote Control section. Please refer to the MIDI and Key Remote Control chapter for more
information about MIDI assignments.

The New Button Appears in the Control Bar When Key Map Mode Is Active.

Note that, by default, launching a Session View scene will not activate recording in empty record-
enabled slots belonging to that scene. However, you can use the Start Recording on Scene Launch

option from the Record, Warp & Launch Settings to tell Live that you do want empty scene slots to
record under these circumstances.

19.3.3 Overdub Recording MIDI Patterns

Live makes pattern-oriented recording of drums and the like quite easy. Using Live’s Impulse instrument
and the following technique, you can successively build up drum patterns while listening to the result.
Or, using an instrument such as Simpler, which allows for chromatic playing, you can build up
melodies or harmonies, note by note.
