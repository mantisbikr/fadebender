the current grid settings.
Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) + the up and down arrow keys doubles or halves the loop length.

points, while dragging the brace bar horizontally moves the loop without changing its length.

To trigger playback from the loop brace’s starting point, enable the Set Song Start Time Here
command in the brace’s context menu. This command overrules the default behavior, which triggers
playback at the insert marker or active time selection.
