The Computer MIDI Keyboard Layout.

Single letter shortcuts can still be used when the Computer MIDI Keyboard is active by adding
Shift , e.g., Shift

S to solo a track.

39.24 Momentary Latching Shortcuts

Some shortcuts can be momentarily latched. This means you can hold down the shortcut key and
briefly toggle the shortcut action. After releasing the key, Live’s UI will return to its previous state.
Momentary latching becomes available after holding down a shortcut key for about 500 ms. The
following shortcut keys can be momentarily latched:

•
•
•
•
•
•

A toggles Arrangement automation mode
B toggles Draw Mode
S toggles soloing the selected track
Z toggles zooming into the Arrangement selection
F1 through F8 toggle the Track Activator switch on and off for the first eight tracks
Tab toggles between Arrangement and Session View

If needed, momentary latching can be turned off using the Options.txt entry: -DisableHotKeyLatching

39.25 General Keyboard Navigation and
Workflow

You can navigate through most of Live’s menus, views and controls using the computer keyboard.

The Navigate menu in Live’s menu bar contains commands for moving keyboard focus to different
areas of the UI, as well as options for using Tab to navigate between controls. Additional navigation
commands can also be found in the Display & Input Settings.

39.25.1 Using Tab for Navigation

When the Use Tab to Move Focus option is enabled, the Tab key can be used to navigate in the
following ways:

•
•

Tab moves to the next control
Shift

Tab moves to the previous control

The Tab key can also be used to navigate between controls in the Session and Arrangement mixers
via these shortcuts:

•
•

Ctrl

Ctrl

Tab (Win) / Option
Shift

Tab (Win) / Option

the same row

Tab (Mac) moves to the next control in the same row

Shift

Tab (Mac) moves to the previous control in

When Use Tab to Move Focus is off, pressing the Tab key will switch between Session and
Arrangement View, as in previous Live versions.

In addition to using Tab to move focus, the following navigation options are also available:

•

•

Tab will navigate to the last control. This option can be enabled via

Wrap Tab Navigation - When this option is enabled, navigating with Tab will not stop at the
last control in a focused view, but will navigate back to the first control. If the first control is
selected, using Shift
the Navigate menu or the Display & Input Settings.
Move Clips with Arrow Keys - This option is enabled by default, and lets you use the left and
right arrow keys to move selected clips and/or the time selection in Arrangement View. This
behavior can be switched off in the Display & Input Settings if needed. When off, pressing the
left arrow key collapses the time selection to the start point, while pressing the right arrow key
collapses the time selection to the end point.

39.25.2 Navigating Between Controls in the Settings Menu

The Tab and Shift
These shortcuts work regardless of whether the Use Tab to Move Focus option is active or not.

Tab keys can be used to navigate between options inside the Settings tabs.

When a command is focused in any of the Settings tabs, the up and down arrow keys can be used to
change the state of a toggle, make value adjustments, or cycle through the available options for a
given command. It is also possible to use the Enter key to switch between toggle states.

To navigate between the different tabs in the Settings Page Chooser, use Ctrl
Shift
Option

Tab (Win) /
Tab (Mac) or the up
and down arrow keys when the chooser is focused. If the keyboard focus is on the first control of any
given Settings tab, use the Shift

Tab shortcut to return the focus to the Settings Page Chooser.

Tab (Mac) and Ctrl

Tab (Win) / Option

Shift

39.26 Accessing Menus

On Windows, you can access each menu by pressing Alt and the first letter of the menu ( Alt
for “File,” for instance). While a menu is open, you can use:

F

•
•
•

The up and down arrow keys to navigate the menu items.
The right and left arrow keys to open the neighboring menu.
Enter to choose a menu item.

On Mac, you can access individual menu entries by pressing Cmd
? . This opens a search field that
will suggest menu entries as you type. You can navigate the suggested options by pressing the up and
down arrow keys and then press Enter to choose one.

39.27 Using Live’s Context Menu

A context menu is available in different areas of Live for quick access to commonly used menu items
and actions. To access the context menu, right-click (Win) / Ctrl-click (Mac) on the part of the
interface where you would like to execute a particular command. The context menu can also be
opened using the shortcut Menu or Shift
M on Mac. It is
worth noting that the context menu may sometimes contain applicable options from Live’s Settings.
You should change these options with care, as they will affect not only the currently selected item but
also the general settings of the program.

F10 on Windows or VO

Shift

Some commands only appear in the context menu. Among these are: various options for working with
the browser, special grid marker commands for directing Auto-Warp, detailed options for zoom-
adaptive and fixed grid line width, copying and pasting for Operator’s envelopes and oscillators, and
numerous device-specific commands.
