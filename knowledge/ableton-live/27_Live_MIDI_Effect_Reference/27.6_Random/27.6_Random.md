# 27.6 Random

The Random Effect.

Random adds an element of unpredictability to note sequences by randomizing the pitch of incoming
notes.

The Chance control determines how likely it is that an incoming note’s pitch will be randomly altered.
You can think of it as a dry/wet control for randomness.

The random value that determines the pitch change is created by two variables: the Choices and
Interval controls. The Choices control defines the number of possible pitches, ranging from 1 to 24. The

Interval control defines the number of possible intervals between the pitches. The values of these two
controls are multiplied to determine the total range of possible pitches relative to the incoming note.

For example, when Chance is set to 50%, Choices is set to 1, and Interval is set to 12, repeatedly
playing C3 results in half of the notes playing at C3 and half at C4, in no particular order. If you swap
the Choices and Interval values by setting Choices to 12 and Interval to 1, half of the notes will play at
C3, while the other half will play at any note between C#3 and C4. These examples assume that
Mode is set to Random and Sign is set to Add, which are the default settings.

Mode determines how the randomization occurs: Random assigns pitches in no particular order, while
Alt cycles through pitches in a fixed round-robin order. The Chance control behaves differently in this
mode: at 100%, the next output note will always be the next note in the sequence, while at 0%, the
next output note will always be the incoming note.

For example, when Chance is set to 100%, Choices is set to 12, and Interval is set to 1, playing C3
once plays C3, and each successive C3 plays the next semitone higher until C4, at which point the
cycle starts over from C3. When Chance is set to 100% and Choices and Interval are set to 2,
incoming C3s alternate between C3 and D3. This behavior is ideal for simulating upbow and
downbow alternation with stringed instruments, or alternating right- and left-hand drum samples.

Sign determines how random pitches are generated relative to the incoming note:

•
•
•

Add generates random pitches that are higher than the original note.
Sub generates random pitches that are lower than the original note.
Bi generates random pitches that can be both higher and lower than the original note.

The LEDs to the right of the Chance control indicate how random pitches are assigned:

•
•
•

The + LED flashes when a pitch above the original note is generated.
The 0 LED flashes when the pitch remains unchanged.
The - LED flashes when a pitch below the original note is generated.

You can enable the Use Current Scale toggle in the device title bar to constrain randomly generated
pitches to the clip’s scale. This ensures that the output values stay within a specific harmonic range.
When using Random’s Alt mode with a defined scale, you can create the effect of a simple yet
unpredictable step sequencer.

27.7 Scale

The Scale Effect.

Scale remaps notes based on a defined scale. Each incoming note is assigned an outgoing
equivalent in a matrix. This means you can convert all incoming Cs to Ds, for example.

The Note Matrix uses a 13x13 grid where each row and column corresponds to the 12 notes in an
octave. The X-axis shows the incoming note values, while the Y-axis shows their outgoing equivalents.

The black squares correspond to the black keys on a keyboard. The highlighted squares determine
how each note is mapped based on the set scale. The scale mapping begins from the root note,
located in the bottom left corner of the Note Matrix. You can set the root note using the Base chooser
and select a scale using the Scale Name chooser. Alternatively, you can enable the Use Current
Scale toggle in the device title bar to apply the clip’s root note and scale. Once enabled, the Base
and Scale Name choosers are deactivated, as the clip defines these settings.

You can create your own scale by selecting User from the Scale Name chooser. By default, each
highlighted square is mapped to its corresponding note within an octave — C outputs C, C# outputs
C#, and so on. You can move highlighted squares with the mouse or delete them with mouse clicks to
customize which notes are included in the scale. Removing a note from the Note Matrix means that
note will no longer be output, even if played.

Use the Transpose slider to raise or lower the pitch of incoming MIDI notes by ±36 semitones. You
could, for example, shift a melody written in C major to G major by setting Transpose to +7 st.

When the Scale Name is set to User, you can enable the Fold switch to automatically fold notes if their
distance from the original note is greater than six semitones. For example, if an incoming C3 is
mapped to an outgoing A3, enabling Fold means that C3 will map to A2 instead.

The Lowest and Range controls define the note range for the scale mapping. By default, all octaves
are included, but you can limit the range to creatively remap some notes while leaving the rest
unaffected. For example, if Lowest is set to C2 and Range is set to +36, only the notes C2 through B4
will be remapped when using a C major scale. These controls can be used in conjunction with the
Transpose parameter to apply transposition only to a specific range of notes. You can, using the same
settings from the example, set the Transpose control to +7 st so that only the notes between C2 and B4
are transposed, while the others remain unaffected.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
