3. Live Concepts

This chapter introduces the essential concepts of Live. We advise you to read this chapter early in your
Live career, as a solid understanding of the program’s basic principles will help you make full use of
Live’s potential for your music-making.

3.1 The Control Bar

The Control Bar is where you’ll find Live’s transport and tempo controls, as well as other useful controls
to customize Live’s scale and MIDI settings, monitor CPU usage, and toggle between the Session and
Arrangement View.

The Control Bar.

The Control Bar is grouped into nine sections:

Browser Options - This section contains the Show/Hide Browser toggle, which lets you show or hide
Live’s browser, and the Browser Config Menu, which includes the options to expand the browser to
full height and display the Tuning and Groove Pool sections.
