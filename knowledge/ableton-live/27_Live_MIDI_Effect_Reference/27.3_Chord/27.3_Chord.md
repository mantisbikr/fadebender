# 27.3 Chord

The Chord Effect.

As the name suggests, this effect creates a chord using the pitch of each incoming note along with up
to six additional pitches.

You can use the Shift 1-6 controls to assign which pitches are used to contribute to a chord from a
range of ±36 semitones relative to the original note. For example, setting Shift 1 to +4 semitones and
Shift 2 to +7 semitones yields a major chord in which the incoming note is the root. Pitches can be set
in any order — it makes no difference which Shift control is used for which pitch. The LED next to each
Shift knob flashes to indicate when its corresponding note is being played.

Note that the same pitch cannot be assigned to multiple Shift controls. For example, you cannot set
both Shift 2 and Shift 3 to +8 st. If a pitch is already assigned to a Shift control, any additional
assignments of the same pitch will be deactivated.

In addition to setting pitches manually, you can enable the Learn toggle in the device title bar to
assign pitches by playing a chord on an external MIDI controller. To do so, hold the keys you want to

include in the chord. The pitch of the first held key determines the root and is not assigned to a Shift
control; any subsequent pitches are assigned to the Shift controls in order. You can add more pitches
by holding new keys while keeping the original keys held. Once the desired pitches are assigned,
deactivate the Learn toggle.

When the Velocity or Chance toggle is enabled, you can adjust the dynamics of the generated note
using the slider underneath each Shift control:

•

•

Velocity sets the velocity for a generated note. This is a relative control, with a range of 1% to
200%. At 100%, the velocity of the generated note matches the velocity of the incoming note.
Varying the velocities between notes can introduce subtle overtones or dramatically alter a
chord’s balance.
Chance sets the probability that a generated note will play when an incoming note is triggered.
You can set the probability anywhere from 0% to 100%. At 100%, a note is generated for
every incoming note.

Using both Velocity and Chance together is a good way to add dynamic variations to a generated
chord.

You can use the Strum control to add a delay of up to 400 ms between the notes of a generated
chord. At positive values, the strumming starts with the original note, followed by the notes from Shift 1
to Shift 6. At negative values, this order is reversed. You can add duplicate notes by enabling the Play
Duplicate Notes When Strumming option in the device title bar’s context menu.

There are two additional controls that can be used to further shape the strumming:

•

•

Tension adjusts the speed of the strumming. At positive values, the strumming starts slowly and
accelerates with each additional note, while at negative values, it starts quickly and gradually
slows down.
Crescendo applies a velocity ramp to the strummed notes. Positive values create an upward
ramp, and negative values create a downward ramp.

By default, pitches are set in semitones; however, you can enable the Use Current Scale toggle in the
device title bar to set pitches in scale degrees.

You can enable the Send Per Note Events to Generated Notes option in the device title bar’s context
menu to send out MPE data to the notes in a generated chord. When scale awareness is also
enabled, per-note pitch bend messages follow the clip’s scale so that bent chords stay within the
expected harmonic range.

27.4 Note Length

The Note Length Effect.

Note Length alters the length of incoming MIDI notes. It can also be used to trigger notes from MIDI
Note Off messages, instead of the usual Note On messages.

The Trigger Source toggle determines whether the device is triggered by Note On or Note Off
messages. When set to Note On, the length of incoming notes is determined by the Gate and Length
controls. The Gate control defines how the value set by the Length control is applied. At 100%, notes
play for the total duration specified by the Length control. Setting Gate to 200% doubles the length,
while setting it to 50% halves the length. You can use the Time Mode toggles to adjust the length in
milliseconds or tempo-synced beat divisions.

When the device is set to trigger from a Note Off event (the moment a note is released), the timing of
an incoming note is delayed by its length — meaning the note starts at the moment it would have
stopped if triggered by a Note On message. Once the initial delay is reached, the timing specified by
the Gate and Length controls is applied.

Three additional parameters are available when using Note Off messages:

•

•

Release Velocity — Determines the velocity of the output note. The percentage sets the balance
between the incoming note’s Note On and Note Off velocities. If your keyboard does not
support MIDI Note Off velocity, you can leave this set to 0%.
Decay Time — Sets the time needed for an incoming note’s velocity to decay to zero. The
decay begins immediately from the moment the device receives a Note On message. The value
at the time of Note Off becomes the velocity of the output note.

•

Key Scale — Alters the length of output notes based on the pitch of incoming notes. At positive
values, notes below C3 are made progressively longer, while notes above C3 are made
shorter. Negative values invert this behavior.

You can enable the Latch toggle to activate note latching. When using Note On messages, triggered
notes continue playing until the next Note On message is received. When using Note Off messages,
notes are triggered once all keys (or a sustain pedal, if connected) are released and a new Note Off
message is received. In both cases, the Gate and Length controls are deactivated, as the length of
triggered notes depends on the Note On/Off messages. Additionally, the Release Velocity, Decay
Time, and Key Scale controls are deactivated for Note Off messages.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
