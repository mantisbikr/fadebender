# 27.8 Velocity

The Velocity Effect.

Velocity alters the velocity values (1-127) of incoming MIDI notes to ensure their outgoing values stay
within a specified range.

The Velocity Curve grid shows how the incoming velocities that fall within the range set by the Range
and Lowest controls (X-axis) are remapped based on the range set by the Out Hi and Out Low
controls (Y-axis). The resulting curve defines how the velocity values are altered.

You can, for example, set Out Low to 80 and Out High to 127 to constrain all outgoing velocities to a
higher range, even if the original notes were played softly. Note that if Lowest and Out Low are set to

zero, and Range and Out Hi are set to 127, the effect is essentially bypassed, as all incoming velocity
values will output within a similar range.

Velocity values can be remapped for MIDI Note On (Velocity) or Note Off (Rel. Vel.) messages, or
both, depending on the option set via the Operation chooser.

You can choose how incoming velocities that are outside the range set with the Range and Lowest
controls are processed using one of the Mode toggles:

•
•

•

In Clip mode, incoming velocities are clipped so that they stay within the range.
In Gate mode, incoming velocities outside the range are removed altogether. When a note is
blocked by the gate, the LED below the Velocity Curve grid flashes.
In Fixed mode, the Out Hi value defines all outgoing velocity values, regardless of the incoming
velocities.

Random introduces random modulation to all incoming velocities. The range of modulation is
determined by the set value and is influenced by the Output Range controls. For example, when Out
Hi is set to 127 and Out Low is set to 60, a Random value of 50 shifts the velocities up or down by up
to 50 within the range of 60-127.

When using positive Random values, a gray-shaded area appears around the velocity curve to
indicate that the velocities are subject to the set random range.

The Drive and Compand controls can be used to create a more complex velocity curve. Drive pushes
all values in the curve to the outer extremes; Compand can either expand or compress the values
within the boundaries of the curve.

Positive Drive values shift the velocities to the upper part of the range so that most notes play loudly,
while negative values shift the velocities to the lower part of the range so that most notes play softly.

Positive Compand values expand incoming velocities to the outer boundary of the curve, shifting the
outgoing values toward the higher or lower extremes. Negative Compand values compress outgoing
velocities toward the mid-range.

You can use these two controls separately or together to further sculpt the velocity curve, creating a
more defined result within the general range.

28. Live Instrument Reference

Live comes with a selection of custom-designed, built-in instruments, including devices based on
physical modeling, FM synthesis, and wavetable synthesis, among others.

To learn the basics of using instruments in Live, check out the Working with Instruments and Effects
chapter.

Note that different editions of Live have different feature sets, so some instruments covered in this
reference may not be available in all editions.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
