# 27.5 Pitch

The Pitch Effect.

Pitch transposes incoming MIDI notes by ±128 semitones or ±30 scale degrees.

You can use the Pitch control to set the transposition for incoming pitches. By default, notes are
transposed in semitones. Enable the Use Current Scale toggle in the device’s title bar to transpose
notes by scale degrees.

The Step Up and Step Down buttons let you increase or decrease the Pitch control value by the
distance set by the Step Width slider. The Step Width distance can range from 1 to 48 semitones or 1
to 30 scale degrees when Use Current Scale is enabled. All of these controls can be assigned Key
and/or MIDI mappings for real-time adjustment.

The Lowest and Range controls define the pitch range through which notes are allowed to pass
through the effect.

You can select an option in the Mode chooser to determine how notes outside the set range are
processed:

•

•
•

In Block mode, notes outside the range are blocked from passing through. The LED next to the
Range control flashes when this happens.
In Fold mode, notes outside the range are transposed to fit within the range.
In Limit mode, notes are restricted to the range. This means that any notes below the lowest note
in the range are transposed up to that note, and any notes above the highest note in the range
are transposed down to fit.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
