Live. Tab and Shift

Tab can be used to navigate between the controls in this view.

38.5 Editing Automation and Modulation

Envelopes

You can use the computer keyboard to add, edit, and delete breakpoints in automation and
modulation envelopes. Screen readers provide feedback for each action as you make changes.

The actions described below are supported in automation lanes for tracks in the Arrangement View,
as well as in the Envelope Editor for clips.

38.5.1 Navigating Between Breakpoints

You can navigate automation and modulation envelopes using the insert marker, which indicates the
current location on the grid. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the insert marker. As you move
across the envelope, the automation or modulation value at the current location is displayed.

The Automation Value is Shown at the Insert Marker Location.

To create a breakpoint at the insert marker’s location, press Enter . You can either press Enter
again to confirm, or move the breakpoint with the left and right arrow keys before pressing Enter to
place it at a new location.

Press Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) and the left or right arrow key to jump to the previous or next
breakpoint.

When navigating through breakpoints, the currently focused breakpoint is displayed in a different
color from the main envelope. This same color is used when hovering over breakpoints with the
mouse.

A Focused Breakpoint.

38.5.2 Selecting and Editing Breakpoints

To select an existing breakpoint at the insert marker’s location, press the Enter key.

You can also hold Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) and click a breakpoint to move the insert marker to
its location and select it.

Use Tab and Shift

Tab to select the next or previous breakpoint.

Selected breakpoints have a pulsing animation to indicate that they are currently selected and
editable.

A Breakpoint Pulses When Selected.

Moving a selected breakpoint and then undoing the action with Ctrl
causes the previously moved breakpoint to briefly change to the same color shown when a
breakpoint is focused or hovered over. This makes it easier to identify which one was affected —
especially when editing vertically aligned breakpoints.

A Previously Moved Breakpoint Temporarily Uses a Different Color.

To change the automation or modulation value of a selected breakpoint, type a number using the
keyboard or use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the value. Press Enter to confirm the change
and deselect the breakpoint. Alternatively, press Esc to cancel the change and deselect the
breakpoint.

Use the Delete key to remove a selected breakpoint.

38.5.3 Switching Between Automation Envelopes in Arrangement View

You can cycle through all automation envelopes for the devices on a track by pressing Alt (Win) /
Option (Mac) and the up and down arrow keys.

To cycle through all devices parameters — with and without automation envelopes — press Shift
Option (Mac) and the up and down arrow keys.
