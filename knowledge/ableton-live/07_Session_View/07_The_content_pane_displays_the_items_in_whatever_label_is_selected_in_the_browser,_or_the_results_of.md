The content pane displays the items in whatever label is selected in the browser, or the results of
searching and filtering.

8.

The Preview tab displays a waveform for samples and clips, and plays back the sound when the
Preview toggle is activated.

You can adjust how the width is split between the left and right panels of the browser by dragging the
middle divider line horizontally. You can also expand the overall size of the browser by dragging its
right edge to the right or its bottom edge to the bottom of Live’s window. Note that dragging the
browser’s bottom edge will automatically close the Info View, as well the Clip View or Device View
(whichever happens to be open).

It is also possible to set the browser to take up the full height of the application’s window by selecting
the Full-Height Browser option from the View menu. When you select this option, the browser expands
to the bottom of Live’s window, but the Info View, as well as the Clip View or Device View (whichever
is currently active) remain open.

Working in the browser involves choosing one of the labels from the Collections, Library or Places
sections in the sidebar, and then filtering or selecting the items that appear in the content pane. You
can also use the search bar to look for specific items or tags.

4.1 Content Pane

The Content Pane.

The content pane contains a list of items in a given label or the results of a search or filtering. The
Name column is always visible, but you can also show additional columns by selecting them from the
Content Options menu.

The Content Options Menu.

Once you select additional columns to be displayed, you can manually reorder them by clicking on a
column name and dragging it to the desired position.

You can sort the items in the content pane in ascending or descending order in any column by clicking
on the column name. Note that right-clicking on a column name also opens the Content Options
menu.

The Content Options menu also includes the option to show or hide file extensions for the browser
items.

4.2 Search Bar

To find browser content, type your desired search term(s) into the search bar. The results will include
files that match all search terms, as opposed to any. For example, if you search for “electric bass” any
items containing both “electric” and “bass” in their filenames will be displayed.

To search across all Library locations, select the All label or press Ctrl
(Mac) to automatically switch to the All label; this shortcut also places a cursor in the search field.

F (Win) / Cmd

F

The Browser’s Search Field.

You can further refine your search by selecting tags from various filter groups to narrow the results. For
example, if you want to find string sounds, you can type “strings” into the search field and then click
on any tags in the Filters view to display results matching only those tag descriptions.

You Can Search for Content Using Search Terms and Narrow the Results Using Tags.

It is also possible to search for content via tags by typing # into the search bar followed by the tag
name, e.g., #Drums. Auto-complete suggestions for tag names will appear as you start typing after
the hashtag.

You Can Also Find Tagged Content by Searching For Tag Names.

You can click the x button in the search bar to clear any search terms. Note that this does not reset
the Filters view. You can use the Clear button in the Results bar to remove any selected tags as well as
entered search terms.

Use the Clear Button to Remove All Selected Tags.

For mouse-free searching, we suggest the following sequence of keyboard actions:

Type your search terms or tag names;
Down arrow key to jump to the search results;
Up and down arrow keys to scroll the search results;
Esc to clear the search field and show all items in the All label again. Any selected tags will
be cleared as well.

4.2.1 Saving Search Results as Custom Labels

If you like the results of a particular search and want to quickly access them again in the future, you
can create a custom user label containing those search results by clicking the Add Label button to the
right of the Clear button.

Use the Add Label Button to Save Search Results.

Once saved, you can access the label and its contents like any other label in the Library.

A Saved Custom User Label.

You can also use custom labels to store specific items in one place for easy access — similar to using
the Collections labels — by tagging content with your own custom tags and then saving the search
results into a new label.

If you no longer need a custom label you previously added, you can quickly remove it via its right-
click context menu.

You can use a label’s context menu to rename both factory and custom labels. You can also select a
different icon for any label via the context menu, which allows you to further customize your browser.

Context Menu Options for a Custom User Label.

4.3 Browser History

The arrow buttons to the left of the search bar can be used to go forward or backwards in the
browser’s history.

Use the Arrow Buttons to Access the Browser History.

You can also use the following keyboard shortcuts:

•
•

Go forward in the browser’s history: Ctrl
Go back in the browser’s history: Ctrl

] (Win) / Cmd

[ (Win) / Cmd

[ (Mac)

The history includes past searches as well as previous navigation states.

4.4 Filters and Tags

The browser includes a set of filters which can be used to search specific content using descriptive
tags.

The Browser’s Filter View.

The Filter View section consists of filter groups and their associated tags. You can hide the section by
pressing the Show/Hide Filter View toggle, or use the Filter View menu next to the toggle to customize
which filter groups are visible.

4.4.1 Filter Groups

Each filter group contains a set of tags that you can click on to narrow the results that appear in the
content pane. To select multiple tags in one group, use the Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier when
clicking on tags.

The Sounds Filter Group and its Associated Tags.

The set of available filter groups is unique to each label, and the state of enabled filters is saved and
recalled when moving between Library labels. This means you can customize exactly which groups
are shown for every label as needed.

To show additional or all filter groups and their tags, use the Filter View menu.

You Can Choose Which Filters are Displayed for Each Label.

You can also right-click on individual filter group names in the Filter View section to hide those groups
in a given label. Use the Filter View menu’s Reset Filter Groups to Default option to restore the label to
its default set of visible filter groups.

The Results bar shows how many filters are applied at any given time. To reset the Filter View and
remove any selected tags and search terms, click the Clear button in the Results bar.

You can save the filtered results in a custom user label by clicking the Add Label button to the right of
the Clear button.

4.4.2 Tags

Tags are useful for quickly locating or organizing the browser content, especially if you create your
own custom tags. Tags can also be a good way to discover content that you are not familiar with yet
— simply select one of the tags in the Filter View and browse items associated with the tag.

All of Live’s factory content (i.e., content from the Core Library and Live Packs that come with each Live
edition) is tagged with a set of descriptive tags. Content from the third-party Packs available in the
Ableton webshop is tagged with the tags contained within the “Sounds” filter group.

It is not possible to remove the default tags from the factory items; however, you can assign other tags
to those items and even add your own custom tags using the Tag Editor.

Live periodically runs a sound analysis, and as a part of this process assigns tags to user samples that
are up to 60 seconds long. The tag assigned is one that best matches the sound of the sample as per
the sound analysis.

Auto tags can be toggled using the Enable Auto Tags option in the Filter View menu, and can be
removed or changed to user tags in the Tag Editor.

Live also assigns tags based on VST3 meta data to VST3 plug-ins in cases where the plug-ins use a
VST Sub Category that maps to one of Live’s categories.

4.4.3 Tag Editor

The Tag Editor allows you to create and assign tags to any items in the browser. You can also create
your own tag groups to further organize your tags library.

To open the Tag Editor, select the dedicated option from the Filter View menu.

Open the Tag Editor from the Filter View Menu.

Once opened, you will see which tags are currently assigned to the selected browser item from the set
of default filter groups.

The Tag Editor.

You can fold and unfold the groups by clicking on the arrows next to a group’s name. When a group
containing an assigned tag is folded, the arrow is indicated with a bolder background.

A Folded Group Containing Assigned Tags.

To add or remove a tag, check or uncheck the box next to the relevant tag. You can apply multiple
tags to the same browser item by checking multiple boxes. To tag several items at once, hold Shift
and select multiple files in the browser before applying the desired tags.

You can add custom tags to any filter group using the Add Tag… option at the end each group.

Use the Add Tag… Option to Create Custom Tags.

You can also create your own groups using the Add Group… option at the bottom of the Tag Editor.

Use the Add Group… Option to Create Custom Filter Groups.

Once a new filter group is created you can add custom tags for that group. As soon as you assign a
tag from the group to a browser item, the group will appear in the Filter View, as well as in the Filter
View menu. This is a good way to organize browser items for specific uses, such as tagging all of your
field recordings or vocal samples in their own unique groups for easy access later.

You can rename or delete custom tags and filter groups via their right-click context menus. Note that it
is not possible to edit or remove any of the default filter groups or their associated tags.

To close the Tag Editor, press the X button in the upper right corner of the editor or select the relevant
option from the Filter View menu.

4.4.4 Quick Tags

You can quickly view the tags assigned to a selected browser item or assign other tags to it using the
Quick Tags section.

The Quick Tags Section.

The Quick Tags section shows any tags assigned to the selected item. You can assign additional tags
by clicking Add… and then typing the name of a tag. As you start typing, auto-complete suggestions
for tags will appear. Once you assign a tag, it will be added to the Quick Tags section in alphabetical
order alongside the factory tags.

To remove a tag you assigned to an item, use the X next to the tag’s name. Note that it is not possible
to remove the default tags assigned to items.

You can assign tags to or remove them from multiple items in the same way as when working with a
single item. When multiple items are selected, the Quick Tags section shows all of the tags assigned to
any of the items in the selection. Any tags that are not shared between all of the items are marked with
an asterisk.

Tags Marked with an Asterisk.

When you select a tag name in the Quick Tags section, the Status Bar displays the filter group in which
the tag is located.

The Quick Tags section is visible by default, but you can hide it via the dedicated Open Quick Tags
entry in the Filter View menu.

The Open Quick Tags Entry in the Filter View Menu.

4.5 Collections

The Collections labels each have their own assignable color, which you can use to group different
browser items together (including folders) in one place. These labels enable you to quickly organize
and access particular browser items (for example, your favorite or most-used items).

You can assign Collections labels via a selected item’s context menu, or by using the number key
shortcuts 1 through to 7 . Use 0 to reset color assignments.

Note that Collections labels can also be assigned to multiple browser items within a selection.
Additionally, it is possible to assign a color label to different item types. For example, you can assign
the same color label to a drum sound, a MIDI effect, and a plug-in.

Clicking on a Collections label in the sidebar shows all items tagged with that color. Folders that
appear in the Collections labels can be unfolded to show their contents.

In the content pane, square icons indicate the respective color(s) assigned to each item. Note that
although multiple colors can be assigned to an item, no more than three of those colors will be shown
in the content pane.

Browser Items and Their Assigned Colors in the Content Pane.

Each Collection label can be renamed via its context menu, or by pressing Ctrl
R (Mac).

R (Win) / Cmd

You can choose which labels are visible in the browser by clicking the Edit button, which will appear
when hovering the mouse to the right of the Collections header, and checking the Show/Hide Label
option next to each label.

The Collections Edit Button in the Browser.

Editing Shown and Hidden Collections in the Browser.

To exit Edit Mode, click the Done button.

Note that when a hidden unassigned color becomes assigned to a browser item, the Collections label
for that color will be shown in the sidebar automatically. However, visible color labels are not
automatically hidden if all their assignments are removed.

4.6 Library

The Library section consists of various labels that contain different browser items organized by type.
You can use the search bar or filters to find and explore all of the available instruments and sounds in
your library. The Library section is organized as follows:

•

•

•

•

•

All — all items from every label of the browser in a single list with devices at the start and file
types after.
Sounds — all of your Instrument Racks and instrument presets, as well as any instrument preset
tagged with a tag from the Sounds filter group.
Drums — all of your drum presets. This includes default drum devices, drum presets (full Drum
Racks and single drum hits), and drum samples (loops and one shots). In addition, any item
tagged with the Drums.
Instruments — default Live instruments and their presets, as well as all of your Instrument Racks.
These are organized by device rather than by the type of sound.
Audio Effects — default Live audio effect devices and their presets, as well as all of your Audio
Effect Racks, organized by device.

•

•

•

•
•
•
•
•
•

MIDI Effects — default Live MIDI effect devices and their presets, as well as all of your MIDI
Effect Racks, organized by device.
Modulators — default Live modulator devices, as well as any devices tagged with the
Modulator tag from the Devices filter group.
Max for Live — all of your Max for Live devices and presets, as well as any Racks that are built
with those devices.
Plug-Ins — your third-party VST and/or Audio Units plug-ins.
Clips — all of your Live Clips.
Samples — all of your raw audio samples.
Grooves — all of your grooves.
Templates — all of your template Live Sets.
Tunings — all tuning systems in the Core Library and user-saved .ascl or .scl files.

By default, all of the Library labels are visible in the browser. You can customize which labels are
shown by clicking the Edit button that appears when hovering to the right of the Library header and
then selecting or deselecting labels.

The Library Edit Button in the Browser.

Editing Shown and Hidden Labels in the Browser.

When you are finished, click the Done button to exit Edit Mode.

4.7 Places

The Places labels contain your Live Packs, User Library, Current Project folder, and any external
folders that you’ve added to the browser. Additionally, you can enable the Cloud or Push labels in
Places via the corresponding Library Settings options to access files from Ableton Cloud or your
standalone Push in Live.

The actual contents of the Places section will vary depending on how you’ve configured your library.
Available labels include:

•

•
•
•

Packs — Contains Live’s Core Library, any additional Packs that you’ve installed yourself, and
available Pack updates and downloads.
Cloud — Displays synced Sets from Note and Move when Ableton Cloud is enabled in Live.
Push — Shows all files from Push 3 when connected in Standalone Mode.
User Library — Contains items you’ve saved yourself, such as default presets, grooves,
personalized Rack and device presets, samples, Live Clips, etc.

•
•

•

Current Project — Shows all files that belong to the currently open Project.
User Folder — Shows specific folders from any of your hard drives that you’ve added to Live’s
browser.
Add Folder — Click this label to add a folder from any of your hard drives to Places.

4.7.1 Downloading and Installing Packs in the Browser

The Packs label in the browser shows all Packs that come pre-installed with Live, any Packs that you’ve
installed yourself, and available Pack updates and downloads.

Installed Packs appear as a folder in the content pane, which can be unfolded to reveal the included
Pack contents. Presets, samples, and Live Clips installed by Packs will also appear in the appropriate
Library labels.

Installed Packs in the Browser.

To check for existing updates for your installed Packs, navigate to the Packs label and expand the
Updates section.

Available Updates for Installed Packs in the Browser.

You can also view Packs that you own, but have not installed. These uninstalled Packs appear in the
Available Packs section.

Downloadable Packs in the Browser.

You can download any available Packs or updates by clicking the download icon to the right of the
Pack name.

Press the Download Icon to Download a Pack.

While the Pack is downloading, the download icon changes to a pause icon that also indicates the
progress of the Pack’s download.

The Download Progress Is Indicated in Yellow.

Should you need to, you can pause Pack downloads and resume them at a later point. To pause a
download, click the pause icon. When a download is paused, the paused icon changes back to a
download icon. To resume a paused download, click the download icon again.

Note that you can also download a Pack, pause, resume or cancel a download, or install a Pack by
choosing the appropriate command in that Pack’s context menu.

Context Menu Options for a Pack.

You can download several Packs at once by selecting them in the Available Packs list and then
clicking one of the download icons. You can also pause and resume downloading multiple selected
Packs using one of their pause icons.

When the download is complete, you can install a Pack by pressing the Install button.

Press the Install Button to Install a Pack.

Upon pressing the Install button, Live will display a progress bar in a pop-up dialog that indicates the
status of the process.

It can be useful to know the size of a Pack before you download and install it. For example, you may
have limited space on your hard drive. You can configure the browser to show the size of all Packs
that appear in the Updates and Available Packs sections by selecting the relevant option from the
Content Options menu.

Show or Hide the Size of Packs in the Browser.

You can delete an installed Pack via its context menu or by selecting it in the browser and pressing the
Delete key. Note that deleted Packs will appear once again in your list of Available Packs.

By default, updates and downloadable Packs are shown in the Packs label, however, it is possible to
hide the Updates and Available Packs sections. To do so, use the Show Downloadable Packs toggle
in the Library Settings.

Show or Hide Downloadable Packs in the Browser.

4.7.2 Using Ableton Cloud

Ableton Cloud is a service that lets you store up to eight Sets from Move and Note, which you can
access across all Ableton products. When Cloud is enabled in Live, synced Sets appear in the Places
section of the browser.

To enable Cloud functionality in Live, open Settings, go to the Library tab, and switch the Show Cloud
option to On.

The Show Cloud Option in Settings.

Once enabled, a Cloud label will appear in Places. Selecting it displays a message prompting you to
sign in to ableton.com to authorize the service. Click the Sign In button to open a web browser and
log into your ableton.com user account.

Sign In to Enable Ableton Cloud in Live.

After Cloud is activated, your synced Sets will appear within the Cloud label.

Synced Sets in the Browser.

Note that all factory and imported samples used in synced Sets are stored in the User Library, which
must be set and accessible when opening those Sets in Live. If you open a synced Set and see that
samples are missing, check whether your User Library is set to a custom location, such as an external
hard drive. To relink the samples, make sure the custom User Library location is connected and
accessible.

Since Sets can be synced from Move or Note to Live but not the other way around, we recommend
using the Collect All and Save command from the File menu when saving synced Sets you’ve
developed further in Live. This gathers all samples used in the Set into a single Project folder, which
you can then save to a specific location on your computer.

4.7.3 Transferring Files from Push 3 in Standalone Mode

You can develop songs continuously between Push and Live: any Set you make in Standalone Mode
on Push can be opened on or transferred to your computer. You can also transfer Sets back to Push to
continue your work away from your studio, as long as you use native devices, freeze any tracks
containing plug-ins, and collect all of your samples into the Project folder.

Make sure that Push is in Standalone Mode and connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your
computer. By default, the “Show Push” option in Live’s Library Settings will be set to On.

The Show Push Option in Live’s Settings.

When you click on the Push label in Places, you will see any available Push units within range. The
Push name for the device is also shown. If there are multiple Push units in range, you can find the
specific “Push xxx-xxx” name in the Status Tab of Push’s Setup menu; that way you can confirm
exactly which unit will be paired. Click on the Connect button to pair Push with Live.

Connect Push to Transfer Files.

On Push, a six-digit code will be displayed; enter this code in the dialog window that appears in Live,
and then press OK to continue the pairing process.

Once you’ve successfully paired Push with Live, all of your saved Project folders from Standalone
Mode and Push’s User Library will appear in Live’s browser.

Push Project Folders in the Browser.

As long as Push is paired with Live, you can view any new Sets or changes that you make to existing
Sets in Standalone Mode in Live’s browser by switching away from the Push label in Places and then
back again to refresh the list of files.

You can unpair Push and your computer by right-clicking on the Push label in Places and selecting
Disconnect.

Read more about continuity between Push and Live in the Push manual.

4.7.4 User Library

The User Library is where all of your saved custom presets, defaults, Live Clips, template Sets, etc., are
stored. Because the User Library has its own unique location (separate from other installed content), it
can easily be backed up or shared between different Live installations or computers.

By default, the User Library is created at the following location when Live is first installed:

•
•

Windows: \Users\<username>\Documents\Ableton\User Library
Mac: Macintosh HD/Users/<username>/Music/Ableton/User Library

You can set a different location for the User Library using the “Location of User Library” option in the
Library Settings.

Initially, the User Library is mostly empty; it only contains a set of default folders: Clips, Defaults,
Grooves, Presets and Samples. You can add your own custom folders and sub-folders, as well as
remove the default folders if needed.

Folders in the User Library.

Items that you save to your User Library will also be available in the appropriate Library labels.

4.7.4.1 ABL Assets

If you enable Ableton Cloud and sync some Sets from Move or Note, the assets that are a part of
those Sets will be stored in the ABL Assets folder.

4.7.4.2 Chord Banks

The Chord Banks folder contains any custom cord banks you have saved or created for use with the
Stacks MIDI Tool.

4.7.4.3 Clips Folder

Live Clips are stored in the Clips folder. You can drag any clip into the folder to save it.

When saving a MIDI clip, the MIDI data (e.g., notes and automation), as well as any device settings,
are included.

When saving an audio clip, or a MIDI clip that uses a device that references audio samples (such as
Drum Rack, Sampler, etc.), the referenced samples will also be stored with the clip. This happens
automatically when the Browser Behavior option “Collect Files on Export” is set to Always in the
Library Settings, which is the default setting.

4.7.4.4 Defaults Folder

The Defaults folder contains your saved defaults for tracks, devices, effects, Slicing to MIDI options,
and more. Using default presets allows you to recall specific device settings each time you load that
device.

See the Default Presets section for more information about saving and using default presets.

For an overview of all the possible defaults in Live, refer to the Using Defaults article in our Knowledge
Base.

4.7.4.5 Grooves Folder

The Grooves folder is where your custom groove files are stored.

The timing and volume information from any audio or MIDI clip can be extracted to create a new
groove. You can do this by dragging the clip to the Groove Pool or via the Extract Groove command
in the clip’s context menu.

Check out the Using Grooves chapter for more details about how grooves work in Live.

4.7.4.6 Presets Folder

The Presets folder contains your saved Instrument, Max for Live, MIDI and Audio Effect presets.

As with saving clips, any referenced audio samples included in the preset will also be saved.

You can read more about saving device presets in the Saving Presets section of the Working with
Instruments and Effects chapter.

4.7.4.7 Samples Folder

All referenced samples from saved presets, tracks, etc., are stored in the Samples folder.

A separate folder for recorded samples or processed samples will be created as soon as said
samples are saved, depending on their source.

4.7.4.8 Templates Folder

Saved template Sets, as well as any custom default Live Set, are stored in the Templates folder.

See the Template Sets section of the Managing Sets and Files chapter for more details about using
templates.

4.7.4.9 Managing Files in the User Library

You can access an overview of your User Library, including its contents, as well as any missing or
external files, by selecting “Manage Files” from the File menu and then clicking on the “Manage User
Library” button that appears in the Help View.

You Can Manage the User Library in the Help View.

4.7.5 Current Project

The Current Project label contains all of the files that are included in the currently loaded Project.

An Expanded Live Set in the Current Project Label.

You can access all of the tracks in the Set (including their clips and devices), the Return and Main
tracks, as well as any loaded grooves.

Once a Project has been saved at least twice, a Backup folder will appear in the Current Project
label.

Backup Sets in the Current Project Label.

This folder contains the last ten saved versions of the Live Set. You can identify backup Sets by the
timestamp in brackets next to the Set name. Live automatically deletes the oldest backup Set once
there are more than ten backups. Deleted backups are moved to the trash bin.

This feature can be especially useful if you have accidentally overwritten a Project file, or want to
access a previous version of your Live Set.

If you’re working on a Live Set that you haven’t yet saved, there is no Backup folder, and the current
Project refers to a temporary location.

You can right-click on the Current Project label and select Show in Explorer (Win)/Finder(Mac) to
open the Project folder’s location on your computer.

Check out the Live Projects section of the Managing Files and Sets chapter for in depth information
regarding how Project folders and Sets work in Live.

4.7.6 User Folders

Live’s browser allows you to work with your creative tools regardless of where they are installed on
your computer. This allows you to, for example, store large sample collections on one or more

external drives, and still use the browser to access their contents - there is no need to keep files in a
single centralized location.

In order to work with your own folders in Live, you must first add them to the browser, either by
dropping them directly into the Places section from the Explorer (Win)/Finder (Mac), or by using the
Add Folder option in the browser’s sidebar.

The Add Folder Option.

After adding a user folder, Live will scan it, which “teaches” the browser about its contents. How long
the scanning process takes depends on the number of files and sub-folders contained in the folder. A
spinning wheel next to the Places label indicates that scanning is still in progress. Once completed, the
files in the folder will be accessible from Places.

Adding a user folder does not actually move the folder to a new location, but simply makes it
available in Live’s browser. If you reorganize your drives using Explorer (Win)/Finder (Mac), Live
may not be able to find user folders that have been moved or renamed. Additionally, if a user folder is
contained on an external hard drive, and Live is opened while the drive is not connected, the folder
will not be found.

A user folder that cannot be located by Live will still appear in the browser but its name will be grayed
out. You can attempt to find it by using the context menu’s Locate Folder command, or tell Live to
“forget” the folder via the Remove from Sidebar command. You can also use this command to remove
folders that aren’t missing, but which you simply don’t want to work with anymore.

Note: Only add discrete content folders to Places rather than entire hard drives. Adding hard drives or
very large folders can slow the indexing process, or the content may need to be continually re-
indexed each time Live is started.

4.8 Navigating in the Browser

Moving through the files in Live’s browser can be done with either the mouse or the computer
keyboard:

•

•

Scroll up and down in a browser label with the up and down arrow keys, the mousewheel, or
by clicking and dragging while holding the Ctrl
modifier.
Close and open folders, or move between the sidebar and content pane with the left and right
arrow keys.

Alt (Win) / Cmd

Option (Mac)

By default, any previously open folders will close when you open a new one, but you can override
this behavior by holding Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) while opening new folders.

4.9 Previewing Files

Live allows you to preview samples, clips, and instrument presets directly in the browser. This can help
give you an idea of how something sounds before adding a new element to your Set.

To enable previewing, activate the Preview toggle next to the Preview Tab at the bottom of the
browser.

The Preview Toggle.

Once enabled, you can preview a file in the browser by selecting it. Use the up and down arrow keys
to move between files and their audio previews.

You can preview files even when the Preview toggle is not enabled by pressing Shift
the right arrow key when a browser item is selected.

Enter or

When a file is being previewed, a waveform is shown in the Preview Tab. You can click in the scrub
area to make playback jump to that point. Note that it is not possible to scrub clips that have been
saved with Warp turned off.

The Preview Tab’s Scrub Area.

By default, the Raw button is deactivated, which allows Live to preview files at the beginning of the
next bar when transport is running. This helps you get an idea of how the sound fits into your current
project. Enable the Raw button to preview files at their original tempo. Audio previews are looped
when Raw is deactivated and unlooped when Raw is enabled.

Please note that scrubbing is not possible when Raw is enabled.

You can adjust the volume of audio previews using the Main track’s Preview/Cue Volume knob.

The Preview/Cue Volume Knob.

If you have an audio interface with at least four dedicated outputs (or two dedicated stereo outputs),
you can preview or cue files via headphones connected to a separate pair of outs — while the music
continues to play from the Main outputs. Check out the Soloing and Cueing section of the Mixing
chapter to learn how to set up Live for cueing.

4.10 Hot-Swap Mode

Hot-Swap Mode can be used to quickly preview and swap out sounds via the browser. You can enter
Hot-Swap Mode by pressing the Q key, or by clicking any of the hot-swap buttons on devices.

The Hot-Swap Button in an Instrument Rack.

When Hot-Swap Mode is enabled, a temporary connection is established between the browser and
the selected device on a track. This allows you to access and preview other devices directly in the
browser.

You can navigate through browser items using the up and down arrow keys to hear an audio preview
of whatever is selected. When you find a new sound that interests you, press the Enter key to load
the corresponding device in place of the one currently on the track.

Hot-Swap Mode Results for a Drift Preset.

For devices that use samples, such as Simpler, Drum Rack, Sampler and Impulse, you can swap out
the entire device preset itself using the hot-swap button in the device title bar, as well as the individual
samples using the hot-swap buttons that appear in the following locations:

•
•
•
•

Simpler - on the lower right side of the Sample Display.
Drum Rack - on each of the Drum Rack pads.
Sampler - at the top left of the Zone Editor, when it is expanded.
Impulse - on each of the sample slots.

Hot-Swap Mode Results for a Drum Rack Pad.

To exit Hot-Swap Mode you can use the Q key, or click the X button in the browser content pane or
on the device’s hot-swap button.

4.11 Adding Content from the Browser to a Live

Set

There are several ways to add browser content to a Live Set:

•

•

•

•

Items can be dragged and dropped from the browser into tracks in the Session or Arrangement
View. Dragging and dropping content from the browser into the space to the right of Session
View tracks or below Arrangement View tracks will create a new track and place the new
item(s) there.
In the Session View, double-clicking or pressing Enter on a device in the browser will load it
into the currently selected track. Similarly, double-clicking or pressing Enter on a sample will
load it into the currently selected track. Samples will be loaded into a Simpler device for MIDI
tracks, or into a clip slot for audio tracks.
In the Arrangement View, double-clicking or pressing Enter on a device or sample in the
browser will load the item onto whatever track is currently selected.
Files can also be dropped directly into Live from the Explorer (Win)/Finder (Mac).

5. Managing Files and Sets

Various types of files are used in making music with Live, from those containing MIDI and audio, to
more program-specific files such as Live Clips and Live Sets. This chapter will explain everything you
need to know about working with each of these file types in Live.

5.1 Sample Files

A sample is a file that contains audio data. Live can play both uncompressed file formats (WAV, AIF
and Sound Designer II for Mac) and compressed file formats (MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, Ogg FLAC
and FLAC).

As Live plays the samples directly from disk, you can work with a large number of (large) samples
without running into RAM memory limitations. Please note, however, that you may run into disk
throughput problems if your disk is nearly full, and/or (on Windows systems) highly fragmented. Hard
drive rotation speed can also affect disk performance. Refer to the section on managing the disk load
for more information.

Live can combine uncompressed mono or stereo samples of any length, sample rate or bit depth
without prior conversion. To play a compressed sample, Live decodes the sample and writes the result
to a temporary, uncompressed sample file. This usually happens quickly enough that you will be able
to play the sample right away, without waiting for the decoding process to finish.

Note: When adding a long sample to a project, Live might tell you that it cannot play the sample
before it has been analyzed. Please see the section on analysis for an explanation.

5.1.1 The Decoding Cache

To save computational resources, Live keeps the decoded sample files of compressed samples in the
cache. Maintenance of the cache is normally not required, as Live automatically deletes older files to
make room for those that are new. You can, however, impose limits on the cache size using the File &
Folder Settings’ Decoding Cache section. The cache will not grow larger than the Maximum Cache
Size setting, and it will always leave the Minimum Free Space on the hard disk. Pressing the nearby
Cleanup button will delete all files not being used by the current Live Set.

Settings for the Decoding Cache.

5.1.2 Analysis Files (.asd)

An analysis file is a little file that Live creates when a sample file is brought into the program for the first
time. The analysis file contains data gathered by Live to help optimize the stretching quality, speed up
the waveform display, and automatically detect the tempo of long samples.

When adding a long sample to a project, Live might tell you that it cannot play the sample before it
has been analyzed. This will not happen if the sample has already been analyzed (i.e., Live finds an
analysis file for this sample), or if the Record, Warp & Launch Settings’ Auto-Warp Long Samples
preference has been deactivated.

An analysis file can also store default clip settings for the sample:

Clicking the Clip View’s Save button will store the current clip’s settings with the sample’s analysis file.
The next time the sample is dragged into Live, it will appear with all its clip settings intact. This is
particularly useful for retaining Warp Marker settings with the sample. Storing default clip settings with
the analysis file is different from saving the clip as a Live Clip.

While analysis files are a handy way to store default information about a particular sample’s settings,
keep in mind that you can use different settings for each clip within a Live Set — even if those clips
refer to the same sample on disk. But if you drag a new version of the sample into a Live Set, Live will
use the settings stored in the analysis file for the newly created clip.

The analysis file’s name is the same as that of the associated sample, with an added “.asd“ extension.
Live puts this analysis file in the same folder as the sample.

 Samples that have an .asd file are displayed like this in the browser.

 Samples without an .asd file look like this.

The analysis files themselves do not appear in Live’s browser.

Note that you can suppress the creation of .asd files by turning off the Create Analysis Files option in
the File & Folder Settings. All data (except for the default clip settings) can be recreated by Live if
the .asd file is missing, however this will take some time for longer samples.

5.1.3 Exporting Audio and Video

The File menu’s Export Audio/Video command allows you to export Live’s audio output as new
samples. The resulting files can be used to burn an audio CD for listening purposes or a data CD,
which could serve as a backup of your work or be used with other digital audio applications. If your
Set includes video, you can also use the Export Audio/Video command to export this to a new video
file, which will be created in the same directory as the rendered audio files.

5.1.3.1 Selection Options

The Render Dialog’s Selection Options.

The Export dialog’s Rendered Track chooser offers several options for which audio signal to render:

The Rendered Track Chooser.

•

•

•

•

Main — The post-fader signal at Live’s Main output. If you are monitoring the Main output, you
can be sure that the rendered file will contain exactly what you hear.
All Individual Tracks — The post-fader signal at the output of each individual track, including
return tracks and MIDI tracks with instruments. Live will create a separate sample for each track.
All samples will have the same length, making it easy to align them in other multitrack programs.
Selected Tracks Only — This is identical to the All Individual Tracks option, but only renders
tracks that were selected prior to opening the Export dialog.
(single tracks) — The post-fader signal at the output of the selected track.

The other Selection fields determine the start time and length of the exported material:

•
•

Render Start — Sets the position at which rendering will begin.
Render Length — Determines the length of the rendered sample.

Tip: A fast way to set both the Render Start and Length values is to select a range of time in the
Arrangement View prior to invoking the Export Audio/Video command. But remember — a rendered
audio file contains only what you heard prior to rendering. So, for example, if you’re playing back
some combination of Session View clips and Arrangement material, then that is what will be captured
in your rendered file — regardless of which view is active when you render.

5.1.3.2 Rendering Options

Audio Rendering Options.

The Export dialog offers several audio rendering options:

•

•

•
•

•

•

Include Return and Main Effects – If this is activated, Live will individually render each selected
track with any return tracks used by that track, as well as effects used in the Main track. This is
especially useful when rendering material for a live performance, or when providing stems to a
mixing engineer or remix artist.
Render as Loop — If this is activated, Live will create a sample that can be used as a loop. For
example, suppose your Live Set uses a delay effect. If Render as Loop is on, Live will go
through the rendering process twice: The first pass will not actually write samples to disk, but
add the specified delay effect. As the second pass starts writing audio to disk, it will include the
delay “tail“ resulting from the first pass.
Convert to Mono — If this is activated, Live will create a mono file instead of a stereo file.
Normalize — If this is activated, the sample resulting from the render process will be normalized
(i.e., the file will be amplified so that the highest peak attains the maximum available
headroom).
Create Analysis File — If this is activated, Live will create an .asd file that contains analysis
information about the rendered sample. If you intend to use the new sample in Live, check this
option.
Sample Rate — Note that your choice of sample rate works as follows: if you select a sample
rate equal to or higher than the rate you’re using in your project (as set in the Audio tab of Live’s
Settings), Live will export in a single step, at the sample rate you’ve chosen in the Export dialog.
If you export at a sample rate that is lower than your current project sample rate, Live will first

export at the current project sample rate and then downsample the file in a second step using a
high-quality process. Note that this may take a few moments.

5.1.3.3 Encoding Options

Audio Encoding Options.

•
•
•

•

Encode PCM — If activated, a lossless audio file is created.
File Type — WAV, AIFF, and FLAC formats are available for PCM export.
Bit Depth, Dither Options — If you are rendering at a bit depth lower than 32-bit, choose one of
the dither modes. Dithering adds a small amount of noise to rendered audio, but minimizes
artifacts when reducing the bit depth. By default, Triangular is selected, which is the “safest“
mode to use if there is any possibility of doing additional processing on your file. Rectangular
mode introduces an even smaller amount of dither noise, but at the expense of additional
quantization error. The three Pow-r modes offer successively higher amounts of dithering, but
with the noise pushed above the audible range. Note that dithering is a procedure that should
only be applied once to any given audio file. If you plan to do further processing on your
rendered file, it’s best to render to 32-bit to avoid the need for dithering at this stage. In
particular, the Pow-r modes should never be used for any material that will be sent on to a
further mastering stage — these are for final output only.
Encode MP3 — If activated, a CBR 320 kbps MP3 file is created. It is possible to export PCM
and MP3 simultaneously. If neither toggle is enabled, the Export button will be disabled.

5.1.3.4 Video Rendering Options

Video Rendering Options.

In addition to settings for audio rendering, the Export dialog provides additional options for rendering
video:

•

•

•

Create Video — If this is activated, a video file will be created in the same directory as your
rendered audio. Note that this option is only enabled if you have video clips in the
Arrangement View. Also, it is not possible to only render a video file — enabling video
rendering will always produce a video in addition to rendered audio.
Video Encoder — This chooser allows you to select the encoder to use for the video rendering.
The choices you have here depend on the encoders you have installed.
Video Encoder Settings — This button opens the settings window for the selected encoder. Note
that the settings options will vary depending on the encoder you have chosen. Certain
encoders have no user-configurable options. In this case, the Edit button will be disabled.

Once you’ve made your selections and clicked Export to begin the rendering process, audio
rendering will begin. After the audio rendering is complete, the video will be rendered. Note that,
depending on the encoder used, video rendering may occur in more than one pass. Live will display a
progress bar that will indicate the status of the process.

Unless you’ve specified a special window size or aspect ratio in the encoder settings, the rendered
video file will play back exactly as it appeared during real time playback in Live. The video file will
also contain the rendered audio.

For more information about working with video in Live, see the Working with Video chapter.

5.1.3.5 Real-Time Rendering

Normally, rendering happens as an offline process. But if your Set contains an External Audio Effect
or External Instrument that routes to a hardware effects device or synthesizer, the rendering process is
a bit different. In this case, rendering the Main output happens in real time. If you render single tracks,
all tracks that don’t route to an external device anywhere in their signal paths will be rendered offline.
Then, any tracks that do access these devices will be rendered in real time. Live will automatically

trace each track’s signal flow and detect if real-time rendering is necessary. You’ll then be presented
with several options when you start to render:

Waiting for External Devices to Become Silent.

•

Skip — By default, Live will wait for ten seconds before starting a real-time render. This should
allow any sound from external devices to fade out, but if you need more time (for example, if
you’re waiting for a long reverb tail), you can increase the wait time by typing a new number in
the number box. On the other hand, if you’re sure that your external devices aren’t making any
sound, you can speed the process along by pressing “Skip,“ which will start the render
immediately.

After the render has begun, the dialog changes to show a recording progress bar:

Real-Time Rendering in Progress.

•

•
•

Auto-Restart on drop-outs — Rendering in real-time requires somewhat more CPU power than
non-real-time rendering, and in some cases drop-outs (small gaps or glitches in the audio) can
occur. Live detects when drop-outs happen, and rendering will start again from the beginning if
the Auto-Restart option is enabled.
Restart — Manually restarts the rendering process.
Cancel — Stops the rendering process and deletes the partially rendered file.

The number of rendering attempts (if there has been more than one) will also be listed in the dialog
box. If you find that dropouts and restarts keep happening, you should close other running
applications to allow more processing power for rendering. Please see the chapter on computer
audio resources for more tips on improving performance.

5.2 MIDI Files

A MIDI file contains commands that prompt MIDI compatible synthesizers or instruments, such as
Live’s Simpler, to create specific musical output. MIDI files are exported by hardware and software
MIDI sequencers. Importing MIDI files into Live works differently than with samples: MIDI file data is
incorporated into the Live Set, and the resulting MIDI clips lose all reference to the original file. MIDI
files appear with a special icon in the browser.

A MIDI File in the Browser.

You can import MIDI files by using the browser or the Create menu’s Import MIDI File… command.
Note that when using the Import MIDI File… command in the Arrangement View, the file will be
inserted at the Insert Marker position. When using the command in the Session View, the file will be
inserted in the currently selected clip slot.

5.2.1 Exporting MIDI Files

Live MIDI clips can be exported as Standard MIDI files. To export a MIDI clip, use the File menu’s
Export MIDI Clip command. This command will open a file-save dialog, allowing you to choose the
location for your new MIDI file.

Exporting a MIDI file is different from saving the clip as a Live Clip.

5.3 Live Clips

Individual audio or MIDI clips can be exported to disk in the Live Clip format for easy retrieval and
reuse in any project. Audio clips only contain references to samples on disk (rather than the audio
data itself), so they are very small, which makes it easy to develop and maintain your own collection.

To save a clip from the open Live Set to disk, simply drag it to the Places section of the browser and
drop it into the Current Project or any user folder. For audio clips, Live will manage the copying of the
clip’s sample into this new location based on the selection in the Collect Files on Export chooser. You
can then type in a new name for the clip or confirm the one suggested by Live with Enter .

A Live Clip in the Browser.

Live Clips are a great way of storing your ideas for later use or development, as they save not only the
original clip, including all its clip and envelope settings, but also the original track’s devices. In order
to recreate a Live Clip’s device chain, either drag it into a track containing no clips or devices, or drag
it into the space in the Session or Arrangement View containing no tracks. Note that Live Clips that are
imported into tracks already containing devices or clips will appear with their clip settings but not their
devices. You could, for instance, drop a bassline Live Clip on an existing track that drives a bass
instrument, rather than creating a new track.

Clips belonging to any Live Sets already on disk are also Live Clips. Please see the section on merging
Sets for more on this topic.

Note that storing default clip settings with a sample’s analysis file is different from saving a Live Clip.
The default clip in the .asd file annotates the sample with sensible default values (warp, gain and pitch
settings) so that it will play in a defined way when it is added to a Set. Live Clips, on the other hand,
are stored on disk as separate musical ideas. For example, you could create a number of variations
from the same audio clip by using different warp, pitch, envelope and effect settings, and store them
all as separate Live Clips. In the browser, you could then independently sort and preview these clips,
even though they are all referring to the same source sample.

5.4 Live Sets

The type of document that you create and work on in Live is called a Live Set. Think of this as a single
“song.“ Sets must be saved inside projects, so that Live can keep track of and manage all of the
various components of the Live Set: Live Clips, device presets, any samples used, etc.

5.4.1 Creating, Opening and Saving Sets

Use the File menu’s New Live Set command to create new Live Sets, and the Open Live Set or Open
Recent Set command to open existing ones. In the browser, you can double-click or press Enter on
a Live Set to open it.

The File menu’s Save Live Set command saves the current Live Set exactly as it is, including all clips
and settings.

You can use the Save Live Set As command to save the current Live Set under a different name and/or
in a different directory location, or the Save a Copy command to create a copy of the current Live Set
with a new name and/or new directory location.

5.4.2 Merging Sets

Live makes it easy to merge Sets, which can come in handy when combining work from different
versions or pieces. To add all tracks (except the return tracks) from one Live Set into another, drag the
Set from the browser into the current Set, and drop it onto any track title bar or into the drop area next
to or below the tracks. The tracks from the dropped Set will be completely reconstructed, including
their clips in the Session and Arrangement View, their devices, and their automation.

Session View Drop Area for Importing Live Sets.

Arrangement View Drop Area for Importing Live Sets.

If you prefer to import individual tracks from a Set, you can unfold the Live Set in the browser just as if
it were a folder.

Unfolding a Set to Reveal its Contents.

You can now drag the individual tracks and drop them as described at the beginning of this section.
Any grooves that were saved with your Set are also available as a folder within the unfolded Set.

If you only want the device chain (e.g., a device and its audio or MIDI effects) from another Set, you
can drag in the Devices icon from the Set in the browser.

The Devices Icon in an Expanded Live Set.

You can also drag Group Tracks and nested Group Tracks from Live’s browser. Group Tracks can be
expanded in the browser, allowing you to load an individual track from within.

In addition to unfolding Sets, you can further unfold the tracks within the Sets to access the individual
Session View clips that were used on the track:

Revealing the Session View Clips Contained in a Set.

You can browse, preview and import Session View clips from the Set as if they had been stored as
individual Live Clips. This means that any Live Set can serve as a pool of sounds for any other,
suggesting creative reuse and crossover.

5.4.3 Exporting Session Clips as New Sets

You can export a selection of Session View clips as a new Live Set by dragging them to the browser.
To export a Set, first click and drag, or use the Shift or Ctrl (Win) / Option (Mac) modifiers,
to select more than one Session View clip. Then, simply drag and drop the clips into the Current Project
or any user folder, where you can either confirm Live’s suggested name or type in one of your own.

5.4.4 Template Sets

Use the File menu’s Save Live Set As Default Set… command to save the current Live Set as the default
template. Live will use these settings as the initialized, default state for new Live Sets. You can use this
to pre-configure:

•
•
•
•

Your multichannel input/output setup.
Preset devices, like EQs and Compressors, in every track.
Computer key mappings.
MIDI mappings.

Note that any template Set in Live’s browser can be set as the default Live Set via the Set Default Live
Set entry in the Set’s context menu or the File menu.

In addition to this default template, you can create additional template Sets for different types of
projects, each with their own unique configuration of tracks, devices, etc. To do this, save the current
Live Set using the File menu’s Save Live Set As Template… command. Any Sets saved as a template
will appear in the browser’s Templates category and the Templates folder in the User Library. Note
that the User Library’s Templates folder is automatically created the first time a template Set is saved.
These Sets will then function as templates: they will load with the configuration you saved, but with the
name Untitled.als, ready to be used as a new Set.

Multiple Template Sets in the User Library.

5.4.5 Viewing and Changing a Live Set’s File References

To view a list of the files referenced by the current Live Set, choose the Manage Files command from
the File menu, click the Manage Set button, and then click the View Files button. Live will display one
line for each file used by the Live Set. To list all clips or instruments in the Live Set where the file is
actually used, click the triangle to expand the line. Here is what you can do:

•

Replace a file — Dragging a file from the browser and dropping it on an entry in the list makes
the Live Set reference the new file instead of the old one. For samples used in audio clips, Live
retains the clip properties; the Warp Markers are kept if the new sample has the same or a
greater length as the old sample and discarded otherwise. Please note that replacing a sample
will change all clips in your Set that reference this sample.

Every Entry in the File Reference List is a Drop Target for Files.

•

Hot-swap files — Using the Hot-Swap button at the left-hand side of each entry, you can
quickly browse through alternatives for the file that is currently being referenced. This is like
dragging files here, only quicker.

The File Reference List’s Hot-Swap Button.

•

Edit a referenced sample — using an external application (which can be chosen in the Settings’
File/Folder tab). Clicking the Edit button will open the referenced sample in the external
application. The sample will remain offline as long as the Edit switch is engaged. For samples
used in audio clips, the current set of Warp Markers is retained only if the sample length
remains the same as before. Note that the Edit button is only available for samples, not for other
types of files such as Max for Live devices.

The File Reference List’s Edit Switch.

•

View a file’s location — The Location column states if a file is missing, or if it resides in your User
Library, a Project or somewhere else (“external“). When unfolded, the entry shows the specific
places in the Set where the file is used.

The File Reference List’s Location Column.

5.5 Live Projects

A Live Project is a folder containing Live-related files that belong together. Consider, for example,
work on a piece of music: You start out with an empty Live Set; you record audio and thereby create
new sample files; you drag in samples from collections; you save different versions of the Live Set
along the way so that you can go back and compare. Perhaps you also save Live Clips or device
presets that “belong“ to this particular musical piece. The project folder for this Live Project will
maintain all the files related to this piece of music — and Live’s File Manager will provide the tools you
need to manage them.

5.5.1 Projects and Live Sets

When you save a Live Set under a new name or in a new folder location, Live will create a new
project folder and store the Live Set there — unless you are saving the Live Set into an existing Live
Project. Let’s look at an example to illustrate this process:

We have recorded some audio into a new Live Set. We now save the Live Set under the name
“Tango“ on the Desktop. The Desktop is available in the browser because we have previously added
it as a user folder. Here is the result as displayed by the Live browser:

A Live Set and its Recordings in a Live Project Folder.

The project folder (“Tango Project“) contains the Live Set (“Tango.als“) and a Samples folder, which in
turn contains a Recorded folder with two samples in it. Note that the current Project is also indicated in
the title bar of Live’s application window.

Next, we record another track into our Project. We save the modified version of the Live Set under a
new name so that we do not lose the previous version. Accepting the Save As command’s default
suggestion, we store the new version of the song in the Tango Project folder.

A Second Version of the Live Set Has Been Added to the Project.

The Tango Project now contains two Live Sets, and its Samples/Recorded folder contains the samples
used by both of them.

And now for something completely different: We choose the File menu’s New Live Set command and
record a samba tune. As this has nothing to do with our tango dabblings, we decide to save it outside
the Tango Project folder, say on the Desktop. Live creates a new project folder named Samba Project
next to Tango Project.

A New Project Was Added Next to Tango Project.

So far we have seen how to create Live Projects and save versions of Live Sets into them. How do we
open a Project? Simply by opening any of its contained Live Sets. Double-clicking “Tango with
Piano.als“ opens that Set and the associated Project — as displayed in Live’s title bar.

Let’s suppose that, in the course of our work on “Tango with Piano.als,“ we get sidetracked: The piece
evolves towards something entirely different, and we feel that it should live in a Project of its own. So,
we “Save As…“ under a new name and in some location outside the current Project, say the Desktop:

A New Project Was Added by Saving a Live Set Outside its Original Project.

Note that the new project folder has no Samples folder (yet). “Electro with Piano.als“ is still
referencing the piano sample from the original Tango Project. There is nothing wrong with this except
for when the Tango Project is moved away or deleted; then “Electro with Piano.als“ will be missing
samples. You can prevent this by collecting external files. Even after the fact, Live’s tools for searching
missing files can help solve this problem.

There is actually no need to keep a Project’s Live Set exactly one level below the Project itself. Within a
project folder, you can create any number of sub-folders and move files around to organize them as
desired, although you may need to use the File Manager to “teach“ the Project about the changes
you’ve made.

In general, Live will do what it can to prevent situations such as orphaned (Project-less) Live Sets,
which have the potential of confusing both the user and Live’s file management tools. It cannot,
however, control situations in which Sets or files are moved out of order and become disorganized via
the Explorer (Windows)/Finder (Mac).

A note for users of older Live versions: Live does not allow overwriting Live Sets that were created by
older major versions to prevent compatibility problems. Instead, you will be requested to “Save As…“.
Doing this will ensure that the newly saved Live Sets reside in project folders.

5.5.2 Projects and Presets

By default, new instrument and effect presets are stored in your current Project. At times however, it
may make more sense to save a preset to another folder or to your User Library, so that you can
access them from other Projects. You can drag a preset between folders after saving it, or simply drag
the title bar of the device over a folder in the sidebar, wait for the content pane to open, and then
drop it into the content pane, adding it to the folder.

When saving presets that contain samples to a new location, Live may copy the samples depending
on the settings in the Collect Files on Export chooser in the Library Settings. You can then type in a
new name for the device or confirm the one suggested by Live with Enter .

5.5.3 Managing Files in a Project

Live’s File Manager offers several convenient tools for managing Projects. Once you’ve opened a Live
Set that is part of the Project you wish to manage, choose the Manage Files command from the File
menu, and then click the Manage Project button. The File Manager will present you with an overview
of the Project’s contents and tools for:

•
•
•
•

Locating files that the Project is missing.
Collecting external files into the Project folder.
Listing unused files in the Project.
Packing a Project in Pack format.

5.6 Locating Missing Files

If you load a Live Set, Live Clip or preset that references files which are missing from their referenced
locations, Live’s Status Bar (located at the bottom of the main screen) will display a warning message.
Clips and instrument sample slots that reference missing samples will appear marked “Offline,“ and
Live will play silence instead of the missing samples.

Live’s File Manager offers tools for repairing these missing links. Click on the Status Bar message to
access these. (This is actually a shortcut for choosing the Manage Files command from the File menu,
clicking the Manage Set button, and then clicking the Locate button found in the Missing Files section.)
The File Manager will present you with a list of the missing files and associated controls.

The File Manager’s List of Missing Files.

5.6.1 Manual Repair

To manually fix a broken file reference, locate the missing file in the browser, drag it over to the File
Manager and drop it on the respective line in the list of missing files. Note that Live will not care if the
file you offer is really the file that was missing.

5.6.2 Automatic Repair

Live offers a convenient automatic search function for repairing file references. To send Live on a
search, click the Automatic Search section’s Go button. To reveal detailed options for guiding the
automatic search function, click the neighboring triangular-shaped button.

Automatic Repair Options in the File Manager.

•

•
•

Search Folder — includes a user-defined folder, as well as any sub-folders, in the search. To
select the folder, click the associated Set Folder button.
Search Project — includes this Set’s project folder in the search.
Search Library — includes the Live Library in the search.

For each missing file, the automatic search function may find any number of candidates. Let’s consider
the following cases:

•

•
•

No candidate found — you can choose another folder and try again, or locate the sample
manually.
One candidate found — Live accepts the candidate and considers the problem solved.
Several candidates found — Live requires your assistance: Click the Hot-Swap button (i.e., the
leftmost item in every line of the list of missing files) to have the browser present the candidates
in Hot-Swap Mode. You can now double-click the candidates in the browser to load them, as
the music plays if you like.

5.7 Collecting External Files

To prevent a Live Set from containing broken file references, Live provides the option of collecting (i.e.,
copying) them into the Set’s project folder. This is accomplished via the File Manager:

•
•
•

Choose the Manage Files command from the File menu
Click the Manage Set button
Unfold the triangular-shaped fold button in the External Files section.

Options for Collecting External Files.

Separated by location (other Projects, the User Library, installed by factory Packs, and elsewhere —
sample collections from external drives, for example), the File Manager provides:

•
•
•

A file count and the associated disk space used;
A Show button that will list the files in the browser;
A Yes/No toggle for engaging or disengaging collection.

Note: Make sure to confirm your choices by clicking the File Manager’s Collect and Save button!

The File Manager’s Collect and Save Button.

The File menu’s Collect All and Save command is a shortcut that collects and saves all external files
referenced by the current Set, including those from Live’s Core Library or other installed Packs. Note
that this can cause a lot of copying, especially if your Live Set uses large multisample collections!

5.7.1 Collect Files on Export

When you save Live Clips, device presets or tracks by dragging them into the Browser, Live manages
the copying of associated files based on the selection made in the Collect Files on Export chooser in
the Library Settings. This chooser provides the following options:

•

•
•

Always, the default setting, will copy files into the same folder as the clip, preset, or track
without notification.
When Ask is selected, Live provides a dialog box with options for copying files.
Never means that files will not be copied when saving.

5.8 Aggregated Locating and Collecting

Instead of having to deal with problems while you are in a creative mode, you might prefer putting
aside some dedicated housekeeping time to solve all the problems in one go. Using Live’s File
Manager, you can find missing files and collect external files not only for the current Live Set but also
for:

•

•

•

•

The User Library — choose the Manage Files command from the File menu; then click the
Manage User Library button.
The current Live Project — choose the Manage Files command from the File menu; then click the
Manage Project button.
Any Live Project — right-click on a Project in the browser’s content pane, and choose the
Manage Project option.
Any selection of Live Sets, Live Clips, Live Presets — right-click on the respective items in the
browser, and choose the Manage Files command.

Remember to click the Collect and Save button at the bottom of the File Manager when you are
finished. Otherwise your changes will be discarded.

5.9 Finding Unused Files

Live’s File Manager can find the unused files in a Project for you. You can then review them and
decide to delete them individually or collectively. When searching for “unused“ files, Live will inspect
each file in a Project folder, checking if it is referenced by any of the Live Sets, Live Clips or device
presets in the Project. If not, the file is regarded as unused — even if other Projects or programs still use
it.

To find the unused files for the currently open Project, choose the Manage Files command from the File
menu, click the Manage Project button, and then click on the triangular-shaped fold button next to
“Unused Files“ to access a summary and the Show button. Clicking the Show button makes the
browser list the unused files; there, you can preview samples and delete them if you like.

Note you can also find the unused files from the Library: choose the Manage Files command from the
File menu, then click the Manage Library button, and then see the Unused Files section.

Last but not least, you can find the unused files for all Projects found in a specific folder (and its sub-
folders): right-click on a folder in the browser and choose the Manage Projects command, then see
the Unused Files section. Live inspects each Project individually and labels a file unused even if
another Projects in the same folder does use that file. To prevent losses, you may want to first collect
the files into their respective Projects and then purge the Projects of unused files.

5.10 Packing Projects into Packs

Live’s File Manager provides the option of packing a Live Project in Pack format for convenient
archiving and transfer. To do this, choose the Manage Files command from the File menu, click the
Manage Project button, and then click on the triangular-shaped fold button next to “Packing.“ Click
the Create Pack button to bring up a file-select dialog where you can specify the name and location
of a new Pack file. Creating a new Pack from a Project does not affect the Project. If you want the
Project deleted, you can delete it using the browser.

Live employs lossless compression techniques to minimize the file size of Packs. Depending on the
audio materials in a Project, this saves up to 50 percent in file size.

To unpack a Pack (i.e., to restore the original Live Project), double-click the Pack file (.alp), drag it into
the Live main window, or locate it via the File menu’s Install Pack command.

5.11 File Management FAQs

5.11.1 How Do I Create a Project?

A Project is automatically created whenever you save a Live Set, except when you save it into a
preexisting Project.

5.11.2 How Can I Save Presets Into My Current Project?

You can save presets directly to the current project by dragging from the device’s title bar and
dropping into the Current Project label in the browser. You can then use the File Management tools,
collect any referenced samples, etc.

5.11.3 Can I Work On Multiple Versions of a Set?

If you’d like to work on different versions of the same Live Set, save them into the same Project. This will
usually be the Project that was created when you saved the first version of the Live Set. If a Project
contains multiple Live Sets it will only collect one copy of any samples used by the various versions,
which can save disk space and help with organization.

5.11.4 Where Should I Save My Live Sets?

You can save Live Sets anywhere you want, but saving to pre-existing Project folders can cause
problems, and should be reserved for special cases. You should only save a Live Set to an existing
Project if it is somehow related to the Project — for example, an alternate version of a song that’s
already in the Project.

5.11.5 Can I Use My Own Folder Structure Within a Project Folder?

You can organize your files any way you want within a Project, but you’ll need to use the File
Manager to relink the files that you’ve moved around:

1.

2.
3.

4.

5.

In Live’s Browser or via your operating system, reorganize the files and folders within your
Project folder.
Navigate to the Project folder in the Browser and choose Manage Project via the context menu.
If you’ve changed the original location of any samples used in the Project, the Missing Samples
section of the File Manager will indicate this. Click the Locate button to search for the samples.
Since you know that your samples are all in the Project folder, unfold Automatic Search. Then
enable the Search Project and Fully Rescan Folders options. Finally, click Go to initiate the
search.
When searching is complete, click Collect and Save at the bottom of the File Manager to
update the Project.

6. Arrangement View

The Arrangement View is one of Live’s two main views for song structuring and composition. In
contrast to Session View, which centers around improvisation, looping, and clip launching, the
Arrangement View lets you combine and arrange different elements of a song on a linear timeline. The
complete layout of a song or project is referred to as the Arrangement.

A Song in the Arrangement View.

6.1 Layout

The Upper Area of the Arrangement View.

1.

The Overview displays the Arrangement’s entire layout of clips from start to end and can be
used for zooming and navigation. The black outline represents the currently displayed part of

the Arrangement. You can click and drag horizontally to scroll left or right, or click and drag
vertically to zoom in or out. To zoom out to the full Arrangement, double-click anywhere within
the black outline.
In the beat-time ruler, time is displayed in bars-beats-sixteenths. Clicking and dragging in this
area works the same way as in the Overview: drag left or right to scroll through the timeline, or
drag vertically to zoom. Double-clicking in the beat-time ruler zooms in to the current selection.
If nothing is selected, double-clicking the beat-time ruler zooms out to show the entire
Arrangement.
Clicking anywhere in the scrub area launches playback from that point. You can also hold the
left mouse button down over a point in the scrub area to loop playback for that area based on
the current global launch quantization value.
Locators can be added to any point in the scrub area to trigger playback for multiple areas of
the Arrangement. This is useful for organizing a piece into launchable sections.
Use the Set Locator button to add locators to the scrub area during playback or while
recording. When a locator is selected, the Set Locator button becomes the Delete Locator
button, which can be used to remove locators.
The Previous and Next Locator buttons launch playback for locators. The jump between
triggered locators is quantized based on the global launch quantization value.
Use the Automation Mode toggle to show or hide automation lanes.
The Lock Envelopes toggle can be used to lock envelopes to the song position rather than to
clips. This lets you move clips without moving automation envelopes.

Clips are contained and arranged in a track’s main lane. When using the comping workflow,
you can add clips from various take lanes into the main lane.
Volume, panning, I/O, and additional mixer controls are available via the Arrangement Track
Controls. You can customize which controls are shown using the Arrangement Track Controls
submenu in the View menu.
In the Arrangement View, tracks are stacked vertically. Tracks can be reordered by selecting
and dragging them above or below other tracks.
You can add new tracks to the Arrangement by dragging instruments and devices into the
Mixer Drop Area underneath tracks. Adding instruments or MIDI effects to this area will create
a MIDI track, while adding audio effects will create an audio track.
The Optimize Height and Optimize Width toggles can be used to fit all tracks into the current
height or width of the Arrangement. You can also use the corresponding keyboard shortcuts H
and W .
You can enlarge the waveform display in audio clips using the Waveform Vertical Zoom Level
slider. This is useful for highlighting transients and waveform details without having to adjust the
clip gain. The zoom level is applied to all audio tracks in the Arrangement, as well as new clips
as they are recorded.
In the time ruler, time is displayed in minutes-seconds-milliseconds. You can click and drag in
the time ruler to scroll left or right.
You can open the mixer in Arrangement View via the Mixer option in the View menu or by
using the Mixer View toggle in the bottom right corner of Live’s window.

6.2 Navigation and Zooming

In addition to some of the options described in the Layout section, the following navigation and
zooming methods are also available:

•

•

•

•

•

Alt (Win) / Cmd

To zoom in and out around the current selection progressively, use the + and - keys, or
scroll with the mouse wheel or trackpad while holding Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac). You can
pan the display by clicking and dragging while holding the Ctrl
Option (Mac) modifier.
To zoom in the current selection completely, press Z or use the Zoom to Arrangement Time
Selection command in the View menu. You can revert to the previous zoom state by pressing the
X key. Note that when zooming in multiple times using the Z key, the X key can be
pressed multiple times to go back one step each time the key is pressed.
If you select time on a clip in the Arrangement, the editor in the Clip View will zoom in on that
selected time as well.
To vertically zoom a selected track, scroll inside a track’s main lane with the mouse wheel or
trackpad while holding the Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) modifier. Note that if the
Arrangement contains a time selection, all tracks with selected content will zoom vertically.
To have the Arrangement display follow the song position and scroll automatically, turn on the
Follow switch in the Control Bar, or use the Follow command from the Options menu. Follow will
pause if you make an edit or scroll the view horizontally in the Arrangement, or if you click on
the beat-time ruler. Follow will start again once you stop or restart playback, or click in the
Arrangement or clip scrub area.

The Follow Switch in the Control Bar.

6.3 Transport and Playback

The transport controls in the Control Bar trigger playback of the Arrangement.

You can click the Play button to start playback; to stop playback, click the Stop button. Alternatively,
you can use the space bar to toggle playback on or off.

The Play and Stop Buttons in the Control Bar.

It is also possible to map computer keyboard keys or MIDI messages to the transport controls, which
lets you set up a specific configuration for triggering playback as needed.

The flashing blue insert marker on a track determines where playback starts. By default, the marker is
at the start of the Arrangement. You can click anywhere within a track to move the insert marker and
set a new play position. To return the insert marker to the starting play position, you can double-click
the Stop button or press the Home key (Win) or Function + left arrow key (Mac).

Arrangement Playback Begins from the Insert Marker.

To continue playback from where it last stopped, rather than from the insert marker, hold Shift
while pressing the space bar.

The play position is also accessible via the Control Bar’s Arrangement Position fields.

Set the Play Position in the Arrangement Position Fields.

The Arrangement Position fields show the play position in bars-beats-sixteenths. When one of the
fields is selected, the value can be adjusted using a few different methods: - Use the mouse to adjust
the value by dragging up or down. - Type a number and then press Enter . - Use the up and down
arrow keys to increase or decrease the value.

Adjusting the Arrangement Position fields automatically moves the insert marker.

You can also launch playback using the scrub area above the tracks. By default, the Permanent Scrub
Areas option is enabled in Live’s Display & Input Settings, which lets you click anywhere in the scrub
area to start playback from that point.

Use the Scrub Area to Launch Playback.

When clicking between different points in the scrub area, the jump between triggered play positions is
quantized based on the Quantization Menu’s value in the Control Bar. You can also hold the left
mouse button down on a specific point in the scrub area to play a repeated portion of the
Arrangement based on the global launch quantization value.

Even if the Permanent Scrub Areas option is switched off, you can still scrub through the Arrangement
by Shift -clicking anywhere in the scrub area or in the beat-time ruler.

The editor in the Clip View also has its own scrub area in individual clips that can be used to trigger
playback.

To ensure that MIDI notes play even if playback starts after the beginning of a note, Live will chase
MIDI notes by default. You can also deactivate or reactivate this behavior using the Chase MIDI
Notes command in the Options menu.

6.4 Launching the Arrangement with Locators

To set up multiple locations in the Arrangement for triggering playback, you can add launchable
locators to the scrub area.

Use Locators to Launch Playback in the Arrangement.

The Set Locator button can be used to add locators to any part of the Arrangement in real time during
playback or when recording. Locators are quantized according to the global launch quantization
value set in the Control Bar.

The Set Locator Button.

If you use the Set Locator button while transport is not running, a locator will be added at the insert
marker location or at the start of the time selection. You can also set locators using the Add Locator
option in the scrub area’s context menu or via the Create menu.

Note that when locators are added to the Arrangement, the Set Locator button becomes the Delete
Locator button for any selected locators.

You can jump to locators by clicking on them or by using the Previous and Next Locator buttons below
the Set button. After jumping to the first or last locator in the Arrangement, the Previous and Next
Locator buttons will jump to the Arrangement start or end, respectively.

The Previous and Next Locator Buttons.

Locators can also be triggered using MIDI/key mapping. If the transport is stopped, double-clicking
on a locator will select it and start playback from that point.

Selected locators can be moved by clicking and dragging or by using the arrow keys. You can
rename selected locators using the Rename option in the Edit menu or the shortcut Ctrl
Cmd

R (Mac). You can also enter your own info text descriptions for locators via the Edit Info Text

R (Win) /

option in the Edit menu or the locator’s context menu. To delete a locator, use the Delete key, the
Delete Locator option in the Create menu, or the Delete Locator button.

The Loop to Next Locator command in a locator’s context menu offers a quick way of looping
playback between two locators. The Set Song Start Time Here command can be used to overrule the
default “playback starts at selection“ behavior: when this command is checked, playback starts at the
locator instead.

6.5 Time Signature Changes

Live’s time signature can be changed at any point in the Arrangement using time signature markers. To
add a marker at the current insert marker position, use the Insert Time Signature Change command via
the Create menu or the scrub area’s context menu.

Any time signature with a one- or two-digit numerator and a denominator of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 can be
used as a value for a marker. The numbers must be separated by a delimiter such as a slash, comma,
period, or any number of spaces.

You can also type or adjust time signature values using the Time Signature Numerator and
Denominator fields in the Control Bar. This will change the time signature at the current play location,
and works either with the transport stopped or during playback.

When the Arrangement contains time signature changes, the time signature fields show an automation
LED in the upper left corner.

The Time Signature Fields.

Time signature markers appear just below the beat-time ruler. Note that this marker area is hidden if a
Set contains no meter changes.

Time Signature Changes.

Time signature markers can be moved with the mouse or left and right arrow keys. You can edit the
time signature values for selected markers via the Edit Time Signature command in the Edit menu or the
scrub area’s context menu, or by using the shortcut Ctrl
time signature marker, use the Delete key or the Delete command in the Edit menu.

R (Mac). To delete a

R (Win) / Cmd

Time signature markers are not quantized; they may be placed anywhere in the timeline, and their
positioning is only constrained by the editing grid. This means that it is possible to place meter
changes in “impossible“ places — such as before the end of the previous measure. Doing so creates a
fragmentary bar, which is represented in the scrub area by a crosshatched region. Live is happy to
leave these incomplete measures as they are, but if you’d like your Set to conform to the rules of music
theory, you can choose one of the context menu options for “correcting“ incomplete bars.

A Fragmentary Bar and its Context Menu Options.

Delete Fragmentary Bar Time deletes the duration of the fragmentary bar from the Arrangement,
thereby moving any audio or MIDI clips on either side of the deleted area closer together in the
timeline. The next time signature marker will now fall on the expected barline.

Complete Fragmentary Bar inserts time at the beginning of the fragmentary bar, so that it becomes
complete. The next time signature marker will now fall on the expected barline.

Please note that both of these options affect all tracks — deleting and inserting time changes the
length of the entire Arrangement.

When importing a MIDI file into the Arrangement, you’ll be given an option to import any time
signature information that was saved with the file. If you choose to do this, Live will automatically
create time signature markers in the correct places. This makes it very easy to work with complex
music created in other sequencer or notation software.

6.6 The Arrangement Loop

To repeatedly play a section of the Arrangement, activate the Arrangement Loop using the toggle in
the Control Bar.

The Arrangement Loop Toggle in the Control Bar.

If no clip(s) or time is selected, the loop brace will cover the entire Arrangement. You can set the loop
length numerically using the Loop Start and Loop Length fields in the Control Bar, which determine the
loop start position and loop length, respectively.

The Loop Start Fields (Left) and the Loop Length Fields (Right).

The Loop Selection command in the Edit menu can be used to turn on the Arrangement loop and set
the loop brace to the current time selection. The corresponding shortcut for this command is Ctrl
L (Win) / Cmd

L (Mac), which can also be used toggle the Arrangement loop on or off when a

The Arrangement’s Loop Brace.

The loop brace can be adjusted using the following keys and commands:

•

•

•

•

The left and right arrow keys nudge the loop brace to the left or right based on the current grid
settings.
The up and down arrow keys shift the loop brace left or right in steps based on the loop brace
length.
Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) + the left and right arrow keys shortens or lengthens the loop by
the current grid settings.
Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) + the up and down arrow keys doubles or halves the loop length.

You can also drag the loop brace: dragging from the left or right edge adjusts the loop start/end
points, while dragging the brace bar horizontally moves the loop without changing its length.

To trigger playback from the loop brace’s starting point, enable the Set Song Start Time Here
command in the brace’s context menu. This command overrules the default behavior, which triggers
playback at the insert marker or active time selection.

6.7 Moving and Resizing Clips

A piece of audio or MIDI is represented in the Arrangement View by a clip sitting at some song
position in one of Live’s tracks.

Dragging a clip moves it to another song position or track.

Moving a Clip.

Dragging a clip’s left or right edge changes the clip’s length.

Changing a Clip’s Length.

Note that only the clip bar is draggable, it is not possible to drag from the clip’s waveform or MIDI
display.

Clips snap to the editing grid, as well as various objects in the Arrangement including the edges of
other clips, locators and time signature changes.

To slide the contents of a warped audio clip or a MIDI clip within the clip’s boundaries, hold Ctrl

6.8 Audio Clip Fades and Crossfades

The beginning and end of audio clips in the Arrangement View have adjustable volume fades.
Additionally, adjacent clips on the same audio track can be crossfaded.

Fade controls are located at the edges of audio clips, provided that the tracks are expanded enough
for the fade handles to be visible. If a track is folded or too small, you can adjust the height of the
track until the handles appear.

You can hover over an audio clip to access the fade handles, which initially appear as small squares
at the clip’s edges.

Fade Handles in an Audio Clip.

If Automation Mode is enabled, you can momentarily toggle the fade controls by holding the F key
while hovering over an automation lane.

The Fade In Start and Fade Out End handles let you change the duration of a fade in or fade out
without affecting the fade peaks. However, fade edges cannot move beyond fade peaks. You can
select one of the handles and drag it out across the clip to change the length of the fade. You can
further adjust the fade’s intensity using the Fade Curve handle, which shapes the curve of the fade.

Adjusted Fades in a Clip.

You can also set the length of a fade by selecting a range of time within the clip that includes the clip’s
beginning or end and executing the Create Fade In/Out command in the Create menu or using the
shortcut Ctrl

F (Win) / Cmd

F (Mac).

Option

Alt

Adjacent audio clips can be crossfaded. Creating and editing crossfades is similar to creating and
editing start and end fades:

•
•
•

Click and drag a fade handle over the adjacent clip’s edge to create a crossfade.
Click and drag the slope handle to adjust the shape of the crossfade’s curve.
Select a range of time that includes the boundary between the adjacent clips and execute the
Create Crossfade command from the Create menu.

Crossfaded Clips.

Selecting a fade handle and pressing the Delete key deletes the fade, unless the Create Fades on
Clip Edges option is enabled in the Record, Warp & Launch Settings. In this case, pressing Delete
returns the fade handle to a default length of 4 ms. These default fades help prevent pops or clicks at
clip edges.

Automatically Create Short Fades At Clip Edges.

Another result of enabling the Create Fades on Clip Edges option is that adjacent audio clips will
automatically get 4 ms crossfades. These can then be edited just like manually-created crossfades.

There are some limits to the length of fades and crossfades:

•
•

Fades cannot cross a clip’s loop boundaries.
A clip’s start and end fades cannot overlap each other.

When a fade handle is selected, a dotted black line will appear on the relevant clip to indicate the
limit for that handle. This is especially useful when editing crossfades, because one clip’s loop
boundary may be hidden under the other clip.

Note that fades are a property of clips rather than the tracks that contain them, and are independent
of automation envelopes.

6.9 Selecting Clips and Time

Apart from moving and resizing clips, Arrangement editing is selection-based: you select something
and then execute a command (e.g., Cut, Copy, Paste, Duplicate) on the selection.

Here is how selection works:

•
•

•
•

Clicking a clip selects the clip.
Clicking into the Arrangement background selects a point in time, represented by a flashing
insert marker. The insert marker can then be moved in time with the left and right arrow keys, or
between tracks via the up and down arrow keys. Holding Ctrl (Win) / Option (Mac)
while pressing the left and right arrow keys snaps the insert marker to locators and the edges of
clips in the selected track or tracks.
Clicking and dragging selects a timespan.
 button next to the
To access the time within a clip for editing, unfold its track by clicking the
track name. Note that selected tracks can also be unfolded by pressing the U key. You can
adjust the height of the unfolded track by dragging the split line below the Unfold Track button,
- (Win) / Option
or by using the Alt
(Mac) shortcut keys. You can also resize the height of a track by pressing Alt (Win) /
Option (Mac) while using a pinch gesture on a supported trackpad or touchscreen. To resize
all tracks in the Arrangement View at once, hold Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) while resizing
a single track. You can also unfold all of your tracks at once by holding down the Alt
(Win) / Option (Mac) modifier when clicking the
U
(Win) / Option

 button, or by using the Alt

+ (Win) / Option

+ (Mac) and Alt

U (Mac) shortcut.

-

Adjusting an Unfolded Track’s Height.

•

Clicking and dragging in the clip’s waveform or MIDI display allows you to select time within
the clip.

•

•

•

•

•

Clicking on the loop brace is a shortcut for executing the Edit menu’s Select Loop command,
which selects all material within the loop.
Holding Shift while clicking extends an existing selection in the same track or across tracks.
You can also hold Shift and use the arrow keys to extend or shorten the selection.
Pressing the 0 key deactivates a selection of material, even if it contains multiple clips. Note
that pressing the 0 key while a track header is selected will deactivate that track.
It is possible to reverse a selection of audio material, even if it contains multiple audio clips. To
do this, select the range of time you want to reverse, and choose the Reverse Clip(s) command
from the clip’s context menu or press the R shortcut key. Note that it isn’t possible to reverse a
selection that contains MIDI clips.
You can nudge a selection of material using the left and right arrow keys.

6.10 Using the Editing Grid

To ease Arrangement editing, the cursor will snap to grid lines that represent the meter subdivisions of
the song tempo. The grid can be set to be either zoom-adaptive or fixed.

You can set the width of both zoom-adaptive and fixed grid lines using the context menu available in
either the Arrangement View track main lanes or the MIDI Note Editor in the Clip View.

The following shortcuts, also available as Options menu commands, allow you to quickly adjust the
grid:

•

Ctrl

1 (Win) / Cmd

1 (Mac) narrows the grid, doubling the density of the grid lines

2 (Mac) widens the grid, halving the density of the grid lines (e.g.,

(e.g., from eighth notes to sixteenth notes).
Ctrl

2 (Win) / Cmd
from eighth notes to quarter notes).
3 (Win) / Cmd
Ctrl

•

•

3 (Mac) toggles triplets mode; this would, for instance, change the

grid from eighth notes to eighth note triplets.
Ctrl

4 (Win) / Cmd

•

4 (Mac) turns grid snapping on or off. When the grid is off, the

cursor does not snap to meter subdivisions.
Ctrl

5 (Win) / Cmd

•

5 (Mac) toggles fixed and adaptive grid modes.

The current spacing between adjacent grid lines is displayed above the time ruler in the lower right
corner of the Arrangement View.

You can hold down the Alt (Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier while performing an action to bypass
grid snapping. If the grid is switched off, using the modifier will temporarily enable it.

6.11 Using the …Time Commands

Whereas the standard commands like Cut, Copy and Paste only affect the current selection, their “…
Time“ counterparts act upon all tracks by inserting and deleting time. This means that adding time
inserts the selected time across all tracks in the Arrangement, while removing time deletes the selected
time across all tracks. Any time signature markers within the selected region will also be affected.

•

Cut Time cuts a selection of time from the Arrangement, thereby moving any audio or MIDI clips
on either side of the cut area closer together in the timeline. This command reduces the length of
your Arrangement by whatever amount of time you have cut.

The Selected Area to be Cut (Left), The Result of the Cut Time Command (Right).

•

•

•

•

Paste Time places copied time into the Arrangement, thereby increasing its overall duration by
the length of time you have copied.
Duplicate Time places a copy of the selected timespan into the Arrangement, thereby
increasing its overall duration by the length of the selection.
Delete Time deletes a selection of time from the Arrangement, thereby moving any audio or
MIDI clips on either side of the deleted area closer together in the timeline. This command
reduces the length of your Arrangement by the amount of time you have deleted.
Insert Silence inserts a chosen amount of empty time into the Arrangement starting at the insert
marker.

6.12 Splitting Clips

The Split command divides a clip into individual parts, which is useful for isolating certain areas of one
clip into its own separate clip, or breaking down one clip into multiple parts.

You can click anywhere within a clip’s waveform or MIDI display and then use the shortcut Ctrl
(Win) / Cmd
split clip will have its own clip edges and can be moved or edited like any other clip.

E (Mac) or the Split context menu option to divide the clip at that location. The newly

E

You can also isolate a specific portion within a clip by dragging over the desired area of the clip’s
waveform or MIDI display and then using the same shortcut or context menu option to separate out
that selection into a new clip.

The Result of Splitting a Clip.

6.13 Consolidating Clips

The Consolidate command combines selected material from several adjacent clips into one new clip.
The command can be applied to clips per track or to adjacent clips across multiple tracks in the
Arrangement. Consolidating clips is a good way to join material from several clips into a new loop.

For example, if you have a set of clips that sound good in Arrangement Loop mode that you want to
combine into a loop, you can select your desired clips and then use the Consolidate command in the
Edit menu or main lane context menu, or use the shortcut Ctrl

J (Win) / Cmd

J (Mac).

The Result of Consolidating Clips.

The consolidated clip can be now treated like any other clip; you can for instance, move the clip to a
new position in the Arrangement, or drag MIDI clip edges to create more repetitions.

When consolidating audio clips, a new sample is created for every track in the selection. These
samples are essentially recordings of the time-warping engine’s audio output, prior to processing in
the track’s effects chain and mixer. Hence, the samples incorporate the effects of in-clip attenuation,
time-warping and pitch shifting, and of the respective clip envelopes, however, they do not
incorporate the effects. If you want to create a new sample from the post-effects signal, use the Export
Audio/Video command to export a specific selection of clips into one audio file.

Consolidated samples can be found in the current Set’s Project folder, under Samples/Processed/
Consolidate. If the Set has not yet been saved, consolidated samples are stored at the location
specified by the Temporary Folder.

6.14 Linked-Track Editing

Linked-track editing makes it possible to use the comping workflow and other phase-locked editing
operations on multiple tracks at once.

6.14.1 Linking and Unlinking Tracks

Selected tracks can be linked by using the Link Tracks command in the track header’s context menu.

The Link Tracks Command.

It is also possible to link tracks in a Group Track by opening the Group Track header’s context menu
and using the Link Tracks command.

Linked tracks display a linked-track indicator button in the track headers.

Note that you can create multiple instances of linked tracks in a Set, however each track can only
belong to one of these instances.

Hovering over a track’s linked-track indicator highlights the tracks that are linked together. This can be
especially useful for identifying multiple instances of linked tracks. Clicking on a track’s linked-track
indicator selects all tracks that are linked together.

You can add tracks to an existing instance of linked tracks by first selecting the tracks you want to add,
then holding Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) and using the Link Tracks command in one of the existing
linked track header’s context menu.

Any subset of linked tracks, or a mix of linked and unlinked tracks, can be linked together by selecting
their track headers and clicking the Link Tracks context menu command.

To remove tracks from an instance of linked tracks, select the tracks you want to unlink and use the
Unlink Track(s) option in the track or Group Track header’s context menu.

6.14.2 Editing Linked Tracks

Once you have created an instance of linked tracks, the following operations can be applied to all
tracks simultaneously:

•
•
•
•

Moving and resizing clips.
Selecting clips and time.
Using the “… Time” commands.
Splitting and consolidating clips.

•

•
•

Creating and editing audio clip fades. Only clip fades that start at the same time position can
be adjusted simultaneously.
Arming and disarming tracks.
Renaming, inserting, and deleting take lanes, as well as enabling and disabling Audition Mode
on take lanes. This also applies when take lanes are hidden in some linked tracks.

6.15 The Mixer in Arrangement View

There are two sets of mixer controls available in the Arrangement View: the mixer and the
Arrangement track controls.

The Mixer (Bottom) and Arrangement Track Controls (Right).

The mixer can be opened using the Mixer command in the View menu or the shortcut Ctrl
M (Win) / Cmd
control in the bottom right corner of Live’s window.

M (Mac). You can also show/hide the mixer using the mixer view

Option

Alt

You can customize which controls are available in the mixer via the Mixer Controls submenu in the
View menu.

The Mixer Controls Submenu.

The View menu also contains a submenu for showing/hiding the various Arrangement track controls.

Values and settings are shared between the mixer and Arrangement track controls, so you can use
either to adjust tracks. Note that some controls are only available in the mixer, such as the
Performance Impact indicators, track delays and crossfader.

7. Session View

In Live’s Arrangement View, as in all traditional sequencing programs, everything happens along a
fixed song timeline. For a number of applications, this is a limiting paradigm:

•

•
•

When playing live, or when DJing, the order of pieces, the length of each piece and the order
of parts within each piece is generally not known in advance.
In the theatre, sound has to react to what happens on stage.
When working along with a piece of music or a film score, it can be more efficient and
inspirational to start with an improvisation, which is later refined into the final product.

This is exactly what Live’s unique Session View is for.

7.1 Session View Clips

The Controls for a Session View Clip.

1.

2.

Each clip in the Session View has a triangular button at the left edge. Click the button with the
mouse to “launch“ clip playback at any time, or pre-select a clip by clicking on its name, and
launch it using the computer’s Enter key. You can then move on to the neighboring clips using
the arrow keys. Please refer to the manual section on clip launch settings for details on how to
customize this behavior.
Click on a square Clip Stop button to stop a running clip, either in one of the track’s slots, or in
the Track Status field below the Session grid.

Pressing the 0 key while a Session View clip(s) is selected will deactivate that clip(s).

Clips can be controlled remotely with the computer keyboard or a MIDI controller. They can even be
mapped to MIDI note ranges so that they play chromatically.

Clips can be played at any time and in any order. The layout of clips does not predetermine their
order; the Session grid offers random access to the clips it contains.

Notice that, even if you stop playback for a Session View clip, the Play button in the Control Bar will
remain highlighted, and the Arrangement Position fields will continue running. These fields keep a
continuous flow of musical time going, so that you can always know your position in song time during
a live performance or while recording into the Arrangement, regardless of what your individual
Session clips are doing.

You can always return the Arrangement Position fields to 1.1.1 and stop playback for the entire Live
Set by pressing the Control Bar’s Stop button twice.

The Arrangement Position Fields and the Stop Button.

Clips can be renamed using the Rename command in the Edit menu or the clip’s context menu. You
can rename several selected clips at once by executing the Rename command. You can also enter
your own info text for a clip via the Edit Info Text command in the Edit menu or in the clip’s context
menu. The context menu also contains a color palette where you can choose a custom clip color.

Clips can be reordered by drag-and-drop. Multiple adjacent or nonadjacent clips can be selected at
once by Shift -clicking or Ctrl -clicking, respectively.

Slots in Group Tracks show a shaded area to indicate that at least one of the contained tracks
contains a clip in that scene. The color of the shading is the color of the left-most clip in the group.
These group slots also contain launch buttons which will launch all of the respective clips. Group slots
which have no corresponding clips contain stop buttons. Clicking in any group slot selects all of the
clips it refers to.

Group Slots and Group Launch Buttons.

7.2 Tracks and Scenes

Each vertical column, or track, can play only one clip at a time. It therefore makes sense to put a set of
clips that are supposed to be played alternatively in the same columns: parts of a song, variations of a
drum loop, etc.

Resized Session View Tracks.

For convenient access to more clips at once, you can resize Session View tracks by clicking and
dragging at the edges of their title bars. Tracks can be narrowed this way so that only Clip Launch
buttons and essential track controls are visible. Note that you can resize all Session View tracks at
once by holding Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) while resizing a single track.

A Scene in the Session View.

Note that pressing the 0 key while a Session View track header is selected will deactivate that track.

The horizontal rows are called scenes. The Scene Launch buttons are located in the rightmost column,
which represents the Main track. To launch every clip in a row simultaneously, click on the associated
Scene Launch button. This can be very useful in organizing the live performance of a song with
multiple parts. Note that you can cancel the launch of any previously triggered scene by clicking the
Cancel Scene Launch entry in the Main track’s context menu.

The scene below a launched scene will automatically be selected as the next to be launched unless
the Select Next Scene on Launch option in the Launch Settings is set to “Off.“ This allows you to
trigger scenes from top to bottom without having to select them first. Computer keys or a MIDI
controller can be used to launch scenes and scroll between them.

Scenes can be renamed using the Rename command in the Edit menu or the scene’s context menu.
One can quickly rename several scenes by executing the Rename command and using the computer’s
Tab key to move from one scene to the next. You can also enter your own info text for a scene via

the Edit Info Text command in the Edit menu or in the scene’s context menu. The context menu also
contains a color palette where you can choose a custom scene color.

Scenes can be reordered by drag-and-drop. Multiple adjacent or nonadjacent scenes can be
selected at once by Shift -clicking or Ctrl -clicking, respectively. If you drag a selection of
nonadjacent scenes, they will be collapsed together when dropped. To move nonadjacent scenes
without collapsing, use Ctrl + the up or down arrow keys instead of the mouse.

Each scene has its own number, which is displayed in a column at the right-hand side. Scene numbers
are determined by their position; when a scene is moved, its number changes according to the scene’s
new position.

7.2.1 Editing Scene Tempo and Time Signature Values

Dragging the left edge of the Main track’s title header reveals the Scene Tempo and Scene Time
Signature controls, which allow you to assign a tempo and/or time signature to a selected scene.
These controls are hidden by default. The project will automatically adjust to these parameters when
the scene is launched. To change a scene’s tempo or time signature values:

•
•

Click and drag up or down in any of these fields.
Click and type a number, then hit Enter .

Note that you can also edit tempo and time signature values for scenes in the Scene View.

Any tempo can be used, as long as it is within the range allowed by Live’s Tempo control (20-999
BPM). Any time signature can be used, provided it has a numerator between 1 and 99 and a
denominator with a beat value of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16.

When enabled, the Scene Tempo and Scene Time Signature controls can be disabled and reset via
the Return to Default context menu entry, or pressing the Delete key. You can also disable the
controls by double-clicking them.

You can use the left and right arrow keys to quickly navigate from a selected clip slot or scene to the
Scene Tempo and Scene Time Signature controls. When editing a scene name, or a tempo or time
signature value in the Main track using the keyboard, the Tab or Shift
navigates to the next or previous control, to allow editing these controls quickly. The navigation moves
to the next or previous scene when reaching the last or first control in a scene.

Tab keyboard shortcut

Note: When a Scene Tempo/Time Signature control is selected in the Main track, pressing Enter
once will select the respective scene. Pressing Enter again launches the selected scene.

These Scenes Will Change the Tempo and Time Signature.

Scenes with assigned tempo and/or time signature changes will have a colored Scene Launch button.

Note: Sets that were created in older Live versions than Live 11, with tempo and/or time signature
values specified by scene names, will have their values carried over to the Scene Tempo and/or Time
Signature controls. When opening these Sets in newer versions of Live, the Main track’s width is
adjusted so that the Scene Tempo and Scene Time Signature controls are visible.

7.2.2 Scene View

The Scene View is where scene properties can be set and adjusted.

The Scene View.

Selecting one or multiple scenes, clicking a Scene Tempo or Scene Time Signature control, or clicking
the Main track title bar opens the Scene View.

In the upper section of the Scene View, the Tempo and Signature sliders allow you to edit tempo and
time signature values for the selected scene(s). More information about these controls is available in
the Editing Scene Tempo and Time Signature Values section of this chapter.

Tempo and Time Signature Controls in the Scene View.

In the lower section of the Scene View, controls allow you to edit Follow Actions for the selected
scene(s).

Follow Action Controls in the Scene View.

When a single scene is selected, the Scene View’s title bar displays the name and number (and color,
if assigned) of that scene. Note that when multiple scenes are selected, the Scene View’s title bar
indicates the number of selected scenes instead.

In the context menu of the Scene View’s title bar, two options allow you to rename a scene, and also
choose a custom scene color from the color palette. Note that this also applies when multiple scenes
are selected.

7.3 The Track Status Fields

You can tell a track’s status by looking at the Track Status field just above the active track’s mixer
controls:

A Track Playing a Looping Session Clip.

The pie-chart icon in a clip track represents a looping Session clip. The number to the right of the circle
is the loop length in beats, and the number at the left represents how many times the loop has been
played since its launch. A pie-chart without numbers appears in the Track Status field for a Group
Track if at least one clip in a contained track is currently playing.

… A One-shot Session Clip…

The progress-bar icon represents a one-shot (non-looping) Session clip. The value displays the
remaining play time in minutes:seconds.

… Monitoring the Input…

A microphone icon appears in an audio track that is set to monitor its input. A keyboard icon appears
in a MIDI track under these same circumstances.

… Playing the Arrangement.

If the track is playing clips from the Arrangement, a miniature display representing the Arrangement
clips being played appears.

7.4 Setting Up the Session View Grid

Clips arrive in the Session View by being imported from the browser or through recording.

Dropping Multiple Clips Into the Session View.

If you are dragging multiple clips into your Set, Live defaults to arranging them in one track; vertically
in the Session View or horizontally in the Arrangement View. Hold down Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac)
prior to dropping them so as to lay the clips out in multiple tracks instead. This works for raw audio or
MIDI files but not for Live Clips because they can contain their own embedded devices.

Clips can be moved around the Session grid by drag-and-drop. To move several clips at once, select
them by using the Shift or Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier before dragging. You can also
click into an empty slot and “rubber-band“ select from there.

7.4.1 Select on Launch

By default, clicking a Session View clip’s Launch button also selects the clip, since you will typically
want the Clip View to show the newly launched clip. However, some power-users don’t want the
current focus (e.g., a return track’s devices) to disappear just because a clip has been launched,
especially when starting a clip in order to try it with the return track device settings. Turn off the Select
on Launch option from the Launch Settings if you prefer the view to remain as is when you launch clips
or scenes.

7.4.2 Removing Clip Stop Buttons

Slots Without Clip Stop Buttons.

You can add and remove Clip Stop buttons from the grid using the Edit menu’s Add/Remove Stop
Button command. This is useful for pre-configuring the scene launch behavior: If, for instance, you
don’t want scene 3 to affect track 4, remove the scene 3/track 4 Stop button.

7.4.3 Editing Scenes

In addition to the standard Edit menu commands such as cut, copy, paste and duplicate, there are two
useful commands in the Create menu that apply specifically to scenes:

•
•

Insert Scene inserts an empty scene below the current selection.
Capture and Insert Scene inserts a new scene below the current selection, places copies of the
clips that are currently running in the new scene and launches the new scene immediately with
no audible interruption. This command is very helpful when developing materials in the Session
View. You can capture an interesting moment as a new scene and move on, changing clip
properties and trying clip combinations.

7.5 Recording Sessions into the Arrangement

Your Session View playing can be recorded into the Arrangement, allowing for an improvisational
approach to composing songs and scores.

The Control Bar’s Arrangement Record Button.

When the Arrangement Record button is on, Live logs all of your actions into the Arrangement:

•
•
•
•

The clips launched;
Changes of those clips’ properties;
Changes of the mixer and the devices’ controls, also known as automation;
Tempos and time signature changes, if they are included in the names of launched scenes.

To finish recording, press the Arrangement Record button again, or stop playback.

The Arrangement Selector.

To view the results of your recording, bring up the Arrangement View. As you can see, Live has copied
the clips you launched during recording into the Arrangement, in the appropriate tracks and the
correct song positions. Notice that your recording has not created new audio data, only clips.

The Session clips and the Arrangement clips in one track are mutually exclusive: Only one can play at
a time. When a Session clip is launched, Live stops playing back that track’s Arrangement in favor of
the Session clip. Clicking a Clip Stop button causes the Arrangement playback to stop, which
produces silence.

Arrangement playback does not resume until you explicitly tell Live to resume by clicking the Back to
Arrangement button, which appears in the Arrangement View and lights up to remind you that what
you hear differs from the Arrangement.

The Back to Arrangement Button in the Session View.

The Back to Arrangement Button in the Arrangement View.

To disable all Arrangement clips simultaneously, click on the Stop All Clips button in the Main track
Status field. The clips in the Arrangement and in the Session View exist independently from one
another, which makes it easy to improvise into the Arrangement over and over again until it’s right.

The Stop All Clips Button.

Furthermore, you can move clips not only within the Session grid, but also from the Session View to the
Arrangement and vice versa by using Copy and Paste, by dragging clips over the
 selectors,
or by simply dragging clips between the two windows if you’ve enabled the Second Window option
via Ctrl

W (Mac) or in the View menu.

W (Win) / Cmd

Shift

Shift

 or

When pasting material from the Arrangement into the Session View, Live attempts to preserve the
temporal structure of the clips by laying them out in a matching top-to-bottom order. Moving through
the scenes from the top down, you can reconstruct the original arrangement. This is useful for taking a
composed piece of music back to the improvisational stage.

Another way to move material from the Arrangement to the Session is with the Arrangement View’s
Consolidate Time to New Scene command, which is available from the Create menu or in the context
menu of an Arrangement selection. This command consolidates the material within the selected time
range to one new clip per track. The new clips are placed into a new Session View scene below the
previously selected scene. Note that, as with the Arrangement’s Consolidate command, this command
creates a new sample for every audio track in the selection that contained at least one clip.

8. Clip View

The Clip View is where you can set and adjust clip properties, as well as view and edit clip content
such as audio waveforms, MIDI notes, envelopes, or MPE data.

The Clip View.

To open the Clip View, double-click on a clip in the Session or Arrangement View, click on the Clip
View Selector, or use the Clip View Toggle next to the selector.

The Clip View Toggle and Selector.

Note that when the Clip View Toggle is used while the Device View is open, the Clip View will be
stacked on top of the Device View.

It is also possible to toggle the Clip View with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl
Option

3 (Mac).

Alt

3 (Win) / Cmd

You can resize the Clip View by dragging its top border. If you drag the border to the very bottom of
Live’s window, the view will be automatically closed; it can be reopened using any of the methods
described above.

When opening the Clip View while using Live in a second window, the view will open in the window
that is currently focused. To move the Clip View to the other window, press the F12 key. If the Use
Tab Key to Navigate option is switched off in Live’s Settings, you can also use the Shift
shortcut to move the view between the windows.

Tab

Note that the Clip View always shows the currently selected clip. This means that when working in two
windows, you can select a clip in the window where the Clip View is not open, and the clip will be
displayed in the Clip View in the second window. This behavior allows you to, for example, dedicate
one window to detailed clip editing while using the other window for your work in the Session or
Arrangement.

In the Session View, clicking on a Track Status Display opens the Clip View for editing the clip that is
currently playing in the track.

The Track Status Display for a Looping Clip.

8.1 Clip View Layout

The Clip View consists of a title bar and two sections: clip panels on the left and an editor on the right.
Depending on whether you are working with an audio clip or a MIDI clip, different options are
available in the panels, and a dedicated editor is displayed: the Sample Editor for audio clips and the
MIDI Note Editor for MIDI clips.

The Clip View for an Audio Clip.

The Clip View for a MIDI Clip.

8.1.1 Clip Title Bar

The clip title bar contains the Clip Activator toggle and, for audio clips, the Save Default Clip button. It
also displays the currently selected clip’s name and color.

8.1.1.1 Clip Activator Toggle

You can use the Clip Activator toggle to deactivate a clip so that it does not play when launched in the
Session View or during Arrangement playback. A clip can also be deactivated directly from the
Session or Arrangement through the clip’s context menu, or by pressing the 0 key.

The Clip Activator Toggle.

When multiple clips are selected, toggling the Clip Activator off deactivates all of the clips at the same
time.

8.1.1.2 Clip Name

By default, a clip’s name matches the name of the file it references but can be changed. To rename a
clip, choose the Rename option from the title bar context menu.

It is also possible to rename a clip by selecting it in the Session grid or Arrangement View and using
the Rename command in the Edit menu or the clip’s context menu. The Edit menu and the clip’s context
menu also give you the option to create your own descriptive text for the clip via the Edit Info Text
command.

Note that renaming an audio clip does not rename the referenced sample file. To rename a file, select
it in Live’s browser, and then choose the Edit menu’s Rename command.

When multiple clips are selected, the title bar displays the number of selected clips. You can still
rename all of the selected clips at the same time, but the new name will not be displayed in the Clip
View’s title bar.

8.1.1.3 Clip Color

Newly created clips use the same color as the track on which they’re created, but you can also
manually choose a clip color from the color palette in the Clip View’s title bar context menu or the
clip’s context menu.

If you change the colors of a track’s clips, you can quickly reapply the track’s color to each of the clips
by using the Assign Track Color to Clips command in the track header’s context menu. You can also
apply a Group Track’s color to all of its contained tracks and clips, by using the Assign Track Color to
Grouped Tracks and Clips command in the respective Group Track header’s context menu.

Note that when using the Assign Track Color to Clips or Assign Track Color to Grouped Tracks and
Clips command in the Session View, the color change will only affect the Session clips. Likewise, using
either command in the Arrangement View will only change the color of the Arrangement clips.

When multiple clips are selected, the title bar uses a striped pattern in Live’s UI colors. You can still
select a new color for all of the selected clips, but the change will not be reflected in the title bar
unless a single clip is selected.

8.1.1.4 Saving Default Audio Clip Settings with the Sample

In audio clips, the clip title bar also includes the Save Default Clip button, which you can use to save
the current clip’s settings with the loaded sample. When multiple clips are selected, using the button
will save the clip settings for all samples simultaneously.

The Save Default Clip Button.

Once the clip’s settings are saved, Live will restore them whenever you drop the sample into a Set. This
is especially useful with regard to Warp Markers that have to be set correctly for Live to play long files
in sync. Note that using the Save Default Clip button does not work retroactively: the settings will be
used as the default only for new clips that use the same sample. The settings will not be applied to
previously created clips that use this sample.

The clip data becomes part of the analysis file that accompanies the sample.

Note that storing default clip settings with the sample is different from saving the clip as a Live Clip,
which also saves devices and device settings.

8.1.2 Clip Panels

The left side of the Clip View contains clip panels.

Clip Panels.

For both audio and MIDI clips, the Main and Extended Clip Properties panels contain basic clip
settings such as clip or loop start and end points, time signature, groove, or scale settings, as well as
clip launch properties (when viewing Session View clips).

Given that MIDI clips and audio clips in Live have different sets of properties, they also have some
unique controls relevant to their type of content. These controls are located in additional panels:
(Audio Utilities and Audio Transformation Tools) panels for audio clips, and (Pitch and Time Utilities, as
well as MIDI Transformation and Generative Tools) for MIDI clips.

Clip View panels can be arranged horizontally or vertically. You can also choose to switch between
the horizontal and vertical views automatically depending on the height of the Clip View area.

To arrange the Clip View vertically, drag the right edge of the Clip View panel (next to the Sample
Editor/MIDI Note Editor) to the left; drag it to the right to switch back to horizontal arrangement.
Alternatively, you can use the Arrange Clip View Panels Vertically/Horizontally options in the View
menu to select the desired Clip View arrangement. To change views automatically, you can select the
Arrange Clip View Panels Automatically option from the View menu or from the clip title bar context
menu. Live will remember the Clip View arrangement when you open it again in the future.

Clip View Arranged Horizontally.

Clip View Arranged Vertically.

You can minimize the Clip View panels by double-clicking the clip title bar or selecting the Fold option
from the title bar context menu.

8.1.3 Editor View Modes

The right side of the Clip View contains an editor. There are different editor view modes available,
depending on whether an audio clip or a MIDI clip is loaded. You can toggle between the modes by
clicking on their dedicated tabs, selecting the relevant mode from the View menu, or by using
keyboard shortcuts. In audio clips, you can toggle between the Sample Editor and the Envelope
Editor, while in MIDI clips you can toggle between the MIDI Note Editor, the Envelope Editor, and the
MPE Editor.

The MIDI Note Editor.

The Sample Editor allows you to view the sample’s waveform and control Live’s sample-warping
capabilities.

The Envelope Editor is where you can manage the clip’s envelopes, which can be used to automate or
modulate the effects, mixer, and clip or MIDI controls.

The MIDI Note Editor allows editing and creating MIDI notes and velocities.

You can use the MPE Editor to edit different dimensions of MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) for each
note in a clip.

You can use the Alt
editor view modes.

8.2 Main Clip Properties Panel

Clip View’s leftmost panel includes clip region, loop, time signature, groove, and scale settings.

The Main Clip Properties Panel.

8.2.1 Clip and Loop Region Settings

The section of the clip that plays when a clip is launched is set with the clip’s region and loop controls.
An unlooped clip will play from its start point to its end point or until it is stopped.

You can adjust the clip start and end position using the respective value fields. You can also use the
Set Start and Set End buttons to set the start and end positions during playback; using a Set button will
set the field to the current playhead position. Setting clip start and end positions in this way is
quantized according to global quantization.

Use the Clip Start and End Controls to Change Clip Length.

Note that for warped audio clips, the start and end position fields display values as bars-beats-
sixteenths; for unwarped audio clips, the values are displayed in minutes-seconds-milliseconds.

To have the clip play as a loop, toggle on the Clip Loop toggle. You can set the loop region by
entering the desired values into the Loop Position and Length fields. Note that by default, the Loop
Length field is set to the clip’s total length.

The Loop Controls.

Note that for audio clips, the Warp toggle must be activated in the Audio Utilities panel before the
Clip Loop toggle can be enabled, as unwarped audio clips cannot be looped.

The Loop Position and Length fields are equipped with the Set buttons, which can be used to create
loops spontaneously during playback.

Playing the clip and then clicking the Set Loop Position button moves the beginning of the loop to the
current playback position (rounded to the global quantization setting) and engages the loop. Then,
clicking the Set Loop Length button moves the end of the loop to the current playback position. This lets
you capture the music in a loop on the fly.

While the loop is still off, you can click the Set Loop Length button to set the loop to end at the current
playback position without changing its preset length. This simultaneously activates looping.

The Set buttons, the Clip Loop toggle, the loop region, and the start/end positions can all be mapped
to MIDI controls. You could, for example, use a rotary encoder to move the loop through a sample in
increments the size of the chosen quantization interval.

8.2.2 Clip Time Signature

You can specify the time signature of a MIDI or audio clip using the Clip Time Signature fields. Note
that this setting is relevant only for display purposes; it does not affect playback.

Clip time signature is completely separate from the project’s time signature, and can be set
independently for each clip. This makes it easy to see which clips can be used to create complex
polymetric textures when simultaneously triggering clips with different meters and/or loop lengths.

The Clip Time Signature Fields.

8.2.3 Clip Groove

The Clip Groove chooser lets you select the groove used for the clip from the grooves available in the
Groove Pool.

The Clip Groove Chooser.

You can use the Hot-Swap Groove button in the clip to swap the currently loaded groove to a new
groove selected from Live’s browser. Double-click on a selected groove or hit the Enter key to load
the groove on the clip. Note that this action also replaces the previously loaded groove in the Groove
Pool as well as the clip.

The Commit button under the Clip Groove chooser “writes“ the current groove settings to the clip and
disables the assigned groove. For grooves that use positive velocity values, committing a groove to an
audio clip will create a volume clip envelope in order to convert the groove’s velocity information into
audio volume changes. Note that this will overwrite any volume clip envelope that was already in the
clip.

8.2.4 Clip Scale

The Scale button enables or disables Scale Mode for a clip. You can set a clip’s scale using the Root
Note and Scale Name choosers.

The Scale Controls.

Setting a scale in an audio clip does not affect playback (much like the clip time signature setting has
no effect on playback); instead, scale settings are forwarded to scale aware devices on the device
chain.

When Scale Mode is enabled for a MIDI clip, the keys associated with the notes belonging to the set
scale are highlighted in the MIDI Note Editor piano ruler. This can be useful for writing melodies within
a certain scale. Scale controls for MIDI clips are described in further detail in the Folding and Scales
section of the Editing MIDI chapter.

8.3 Extended Clip Properties

The Extended Clip Properties panel contains the clip launch controls and MIDI bank/program
controls.

The Extended Clip Properties Panel.

Note that since Arrangement clips are not launched, but instead played according to their position on
the timeline, this panel shows the clip launch controls only when a Session View clip is selected. This
means that the panel does not appear in the Clip View at all when an Arrangement audio clip is
selected, and contains only the MIDI bank/program controls when an Arrangement MIDI clip is
selected.

8.3.1 Follow Action and Launch Controls

Tracks can have an unlimited number of groups, separated by empty slots. The Follow Action controls
can be used to define how successive clips in a group are triggered.

The launch controls allow you to specify how clips react to mouse, computer keyboard, or MIDI note
interactions. There are also options for adjusting the clip launch timing, scrubbing clips, and controlling
the effect of MIDI note velocity on the clip’s volume.

Both the Follow Action and launch controls are described in detail in the Launching Clips chapter.

8.3.2 MIDI Clip Bank and Program Change Controls

In MIDI clips, the Extended Clip Properties panel includes settings that allow Live to send MIDI bank/
program change messages to external devices and plug-ins that support MIDI program change
messages.

The Bank and Program Controls.

You can use these controls to send a bank/program change message when launching a clip. If you
are using Live to send MIDI to your synth, this means that each MIDI clip in your Live Set can play a
different sound on your synth. Live offers messages for 128 banks with 128 sub-banks, each of which
has 128 programs. Please see the documentation that came with your synthesizer to determine how
many of these messages it can use.

If you do not want your clip to send program or bank change messages, simply leave the bank/
program choosers set to “—.“

8.4 Audio Utilities Panel

The Audio Utilities panel for audio clips contains warping tools, options for reversing and editing the
sample, controls for adjusting the sample’s tempo, gain, or transposition, as well as toggles that allow
you to create crossfades, load the sample from memory, or use high-quality interpolation when
playing the sample.

The Audio Utilities Panel.

8.4.1 Warp Controls

Live offers a number of controls to adjust the time-warping engine for optimal stretching quality.

The Warp Controls.

When the Warp toggle is off, Live plays the sample at its original tempo, irrespective of the current Live
Set tempo. This is useful for samples that have no inherent rhythmic structure: percussion hits,
atmospheres, sound effects, spoken word and the like. Turn the Warp toggle on to play rhythmically
structured samples (such as sample loops, music recordings, complete music pieces, etc.) in sync with
the current song tempo. A warped sample’s speed follows the tempo as you change the Control Bar’s
Tempo control.

The Control Bar’s Tempo Field.

For accurate warping, Live needs to know the sample’s metrical structure. For properly prepared
loops, tempo and duration are calculated automatically; most of the time this is accurate enough that
the sample is immediately ready for use in Live. For other samples, you may have to provide some
hints.

8.4.2 Reversing Samples

Clicking the Reverse button creates a new sample by reversing the sample referenced by the current
clip.

The Reverse Button.

When you use this option, Live reapplies the old clip’s settings (according to the rules described
below), and replaces the original sample with a new, reversed sample in the Clip View. The new
sample can be found, after saving the Live Set, in the Set’s Project folder, under Samples/Processed/
Reverse. Until the Set is saved, new samples remain at the location specified as the Temporary Folder
in Live’s Settings.

There are a few rules for the reversing process. Firstly, any Warp Markers will remain fixed to their
positions in the sample. This means that a Warp Marker on the downbeat of the second bar of a clip
will end up on the downbeat of the second-to-last bar after reversal. Clip loop/region settings are
similarly flipped. Secondly, clip envelopes remain fixed to their position in time. Therefore, a mixer
volume envelope that lowers the volume of the first half of a clip will continue to do exactly that after
reversal.

The reversal process is quite fast (about as fast as copying), but for very long samples it might take a
little time. When this is the case, a progress bar will be displayed in Live’s Status Bar, and further
actions in the program will be temporarily locked (though currently playing clips will continue to play).
You can play the reversed clip and perform other actions in the program as soon as Live begins to
generate a new waveform into the Sample Editor. Once a sample is reversed, Live stores information
about the original and reversed version until the program is closed. This means that if you were to
revert the sample back to the original version and then reverse it again, the reversal process will be
instantaneous.

In the Session View, it is not possible to reverse multiple clips at the same time. In the Arrangement
View, it is possible to reverse a selection of material, even if it contains multiple clips. To do this, select
the range of time you want to reverse, and choose the Reverse Clip(s) command from the clip’s
context menu, or press the R shortcut key.

It is not recommended that you reverse clips in a live performance situation, as a slight audio glitch
can sometimes occur while Live reapplies the warp and loop settings.

8.4.3 Destructive Sample Editing

Clicking the Edit button opens the sample in an external sample editing application, which you can
specify in the File & Folder Settings.

The Launch Sample Editor Button.

To process a sample in an external program, you have to stop Live’s playback. When you return to
Live, the edited version of the sample will be played back. The current set of Warp Markers is retained
only if the sample length remains the same as it did prior to editing.

Note that changes made to one sample may affect other clips that play the same sample.

8.4.4 Clip Start and End Fades

The Clip Fade toggle, when enabled, applies a short fade to the clip start and end to avoid clicks at
the clip edges. The length of the fade is signal-dependent and ranges from 0-4 milliseconds.

The Clip Fade Toggle.

Note that the toggle is only available for clips in Session View. In Arrangement View, clip fades are
adjusted via envelopes.

The Clip Fade toggle is on by default for all new clips when the Create Fades on Clip Edges option is
enabled in the Record, Warp & Launch Settings.

Automatically Create Short Fades At Clip Edges.

8.4.5 Clip RAM Mode

When you activate the RAM Mode toggle, Live loads the audio referenced by the clip into the
computer’s memory rather than reading it from disk in real time.

The RAM Mode Toggle.

RAM Mode can help with these problems:

•

•

Your computer’s hard disk is too slow to deliver audio for as many tracks as desired in real time.
For more information on disk-related problems, please refer to Managing the Disk Load.
You are experiencing audio dropouts when playing clips in Legato Mode.

Your computer is using the hard disk for swapping out RAM contents that have not been used in a
while. The more clips you are running in RAM Mode, the higher the likelihood for them to be swapped
out. Live can handle disk overloads more gracefully than swapped-out audio arriving late: disk
overloads result in unwanted mutes, whereas RAM overload results in both mutes and rhythmical
“hiccups.“

8.4.6 High Quality Interpolation

If the High Quality toggle is on, Live uses an advanced sample-rate conversion algorithm that
provides better sound quality at the expense of a higher CPU load.

The High Quality Toggle.

Samples processed with the Hi-Q algorithm generate less distortion, particularly at high frequencies,
when transposing a sample and/or matching an imported sample’s sampling rate to the system’s
sampling rate. With this mode enabled, samples can be transposed roughly 19 semitones in either
direction before aliasing is likely to be audible.

8.4.7 Clip Gain and Pitch

On the right of the Audio Utilities panel, you will find the clip gain and pitch controls.

The Clip Gain and Pitch Controls.

The Gain slider, calibrated in dB, changes the clip gain.

When multiple audio clips with different Gain values are selected, the value range is shown with split
triangle handles on the Gain slider.

The Pitch control shifts the clip’s pitch in semitones. This amount can also be adjusted using the value
field on the left underneath the knob. To the right of the semitone value field is another value field for
transposing in cents (100 cents = one semitone).

8.5 Pitch and Time Utilities Panel

The Pitch and Time Utilities panel contains tools that let you quickly manipulate MIDI notes in a clip.
The pitch and time tools affect the selected notes or time range. If nothing is selected, any changes
applied with button controls will affect the whole clip.

The Pitch and Time Utilities Panel.

For a more detailed discussion of MIDI editing, see the Editing MIDI chapter.

8.5.1 Pitch Tools

The Pitch Tools.

The Transpose slider transposes the selection. Type a number to transpose by semitones or scale
degrees (if a clip scale is active).

The Fit to Scale button adjusts the pitches of the selection so that they match the clip’s scale. If a scale
is not active for the clip, this toggle will be inactive.

Clicking the Invert button flips the selection “upside-down” so that the highest note is swapped with
the lowest note.

The Interval Size slider sets the number of semitones or scale degrees (if a clip scale is active) by
which the pitches of new notes will be shifted in relation to the pitches of the original note selection.
Use the Add Interval button to add new notes at an interval specified by the slider.

8.5.2 Time Tools

The Time Tools.

The Stretch knob compresses or stretches the duration of the selected notes, while the ×2 and /2
buttons stretch or compress the note duration, time selection, or loop region by a factor of 2.

The Duration chooser allows you to set a note length value to be applied to the note selection. Use the
Set Length button to apply the note length option specified in the chooser.

The Humanize Amount slider sets the amount of random variation to apply to note start times, up to
half a grid division. Use the Humanize button to apply the random variation to the note selection.

Clicking the Reverse button reverses the selection so that the order of the note pattern is flipped.

Use the Legato button to lengthen or shorten each selected note so that it is just long enough to reach
the beginning of the next note.

8.6 Transform and Generate Panels

The Transform and Generate panels contain different utilities that can be used to manipulate clip
content.

For audio clips, the Transform panel contains the Quantize tool. When working with a warped clip,
you can use the tool to set either the current grid size or a specific meter value for sample
quantization. The Amount control allows setting the percentage of the set quantization value by which
Warp Markers will be moved.

Quantization Options for an Audio Clip.

Note that there is no Generate panel for audio clips.

When working with MIDI Clips, Transform and Generate panels contain various MIDI Tools, a set of
utilities that can be used to enhance your musical composition process, allowing you to shape MIDI
material through transforming or generating notes or MPE data.

Transformation tools affect either selected notes, notes in a time selection, or all notes in the clip. Once
a transformation tool is applied, the original notes are replaced by transformed notes. When the Scale
Mode is on, the pitch controls in the tool use scale degrees instead of semitones.

Generative tools make it possible to quickly add new material by automatically creating patterns of
notes in MIDI clips. Notes will be generated within the time selection range or within the clip loop
range. When the Scale Mode is on, generated note pitches are constrained within the selected scale.

To learn more about the individual transformation and generative tools available in Live, please refer
to the MIDI Tools chapter.

8.7 Zooming and Scrolling in the Clip View’s

Editor

Zooming and scrolling in either the Sample Editor or MIDI Note Editor work much like they do in the
Arrangement View.

Click and drag vertically in the time ruler to smoothly change the zoom level, and horizontally to scroll
the display. You can also scroll with the mousewheel or trackpad.

To zoom in on the current time selection completely, press Z or use the View menu’s Zoom to Clip
Selection command. You can revert back to the previous zoom state by pressing the X key. Note
that when zooming in multiple times using the Z key, the X key can be pressed multiple times to go
back one step each time the key is pressed.

The Clip View Selector provides additional zooming and scrolling functionality. It always shows the
complete clip, from start to end. The black rectangular outline represents the part of the clip that is
currently displayed. You can click within the outline and drag horizontally or vertically to scroll or
zoom.

The Clip View Selector Zoomed In.

To have the editor follow the play position and scroll automatically, turn on the Follow toggle, or use
the Follow command from the Options menu. Follow will pause if you make an edit in the Sample

Editor/MIDI Note Editor. Follow will start again once you stop or restart playback, or click in the
Arrangement or clip scrub area.

The Follow Toggle.

8.8 Playing and Scrubbing Clips

The section of the clip that plays when a clip is launched is set with the clip’s region and loop controls.
An unlooped clip will play from its start marker to its end marker or until it is stopped.

The Clip Start and End Markers.

The markers can be clicked and dragged to new positions in the Sample Editor/MIDI Note Editor, or
they can be moved with the left and right arrow keys. To move the entire clip region (i.e., both the start
and end markers), select either marker, hold down Alt (Win) / Option (Mac), and use the arrow
keys.

When Permanent Scrub Areas is enabled in Live’s Display & Input Settings, clicking in the lower half of
the waveform or in the scrub area below the time ruler will make clip playback jump to that point.

The Clip Scrub Areas.
