# 7.3 The Track Status Fields

You can tell a track’s status by looking at the Track Status field just above the active track’s mixer
controls:

A Track Playing a Looping Session Clip.

The pie-chart icon in a clip track represents a looping Session clip. The number to the right of the circle
is the loop length in beats, and the number at the left represents how many times the loop has been
played since its launch. A pie-chart without numbers appears in the Track Status field for a Group
Track if at least one clip in a contained track is currently playing.

… A One-shot Session Clip…

The progress-bar icon represents a one-shot (non-looping) Session clip. The value displays the
remaining play time in minutes:seconds.

… Monitoring the Input…

A microphone icon appears in an audio track that is set to monitor its input. A keyboard icon appears
in a MIDI track under these same circumstances.

… Playing the Arrangement.

If the track is playing clips from the Arrangement, a miniature display representing the Arrangement
clips being played appears.
