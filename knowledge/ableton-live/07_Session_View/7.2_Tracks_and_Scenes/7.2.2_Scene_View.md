When a single scene is selected, the Scene View’s title bar displays the name and number (and color,
if assigned) of that scene. Note that when multiple scenes are selected, the Scene View’s title bar
indicates the number of selected scenes instead.

In the context menu of the Scene View’s title bar, two options allow you to rename a scene, and also
choose a custom scene color from the color palette. Note that this also applies when multiple scenes
are selected.
