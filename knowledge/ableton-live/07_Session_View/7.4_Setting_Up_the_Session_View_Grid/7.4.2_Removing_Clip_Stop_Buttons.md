# 7.4.2 Removing Clip Stop Buttons

Slots Without Clip Stop Buttons.

You can add and remove Clip Stop buttons from the grid using the Edit menu’s Add/Remove Stop
Button command. This is useful for pre-configuring the scene launch behavior: If, for instance, you
don’t want scene 3 to affect track 4, remove the scene 3/track 4 Stop button.
