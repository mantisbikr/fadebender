# 18.1.1 Additional Mixer Features

Additional Mixer Possibilities.

The Mixer section has several additional features that are not visible by default. The mixer is resizable,
and dragging upwards on the top of the mixer will extend the height of the track meters, adding tick
marks, a numeric volume field and resettable peak level indicators. Increasing a track’s width in this
state will add a decibel scale alongside the meter’s tick marks.

These enhancements are tailored for use in traditional mixing settings, but are available anytime the
Mixer section is displayed.

Because of the enormous headroom of Live’s 32-bit floating point audio engine, Live’s audio and
MIDI tracks can be driven far “into the red“ without causing the signals to clip. The only time that
signals over 0 dB will be problematic is when audio leaves Live and goes into the outside world.
Examples include:

•
•
•

When routing to or from physical inputs and outputs, like those of your sound card.
Audio on the Main track (which is almost always connected to a physical output).
When saving or exporting audio to a file.

Nevertheless, Live provides this optional visual feedback for signals that travel beyond 0 dB in any
track.
