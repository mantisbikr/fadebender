The Meter shows both peak and RMS output levels for the track. While monitoring, however, it
shows peak and RMS input levels. Peak meters show sudden changes in level, while RMS
meters give a better impression of perceived loudness.
The Volume control adjusts the track’s output level. With multiple tracks selected, adjusting the
volume of one of them will adjust the others as well.
