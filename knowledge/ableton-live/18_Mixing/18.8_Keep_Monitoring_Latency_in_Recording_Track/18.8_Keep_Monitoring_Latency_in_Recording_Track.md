# 18.8 Keep Monitoring Latency in Recording Track

Toggles

When monitoring is set to “In” or “Auto,” the “Keep Monitoring Latency in Recording” option will be
enabled by default.

The Keep Latency in Recording Track Toggles.

This adjusts the timing of the recording to match what is heard through Live’s monitoring. Generally
speaking it is recommended to leave this option enabled when recording software instruments or
effects, and to switch it off when recording acoustic instruments or relying on external monitoring.

You can use the toggles or right-click on the In or Auto track monitor buttons to manually switch “Keep
Monitoring Latency in Recorded Audio” on or off.
