# Ableton Live 12 — Compressor

## Overview
Compressor reduces the dynamic range of signals, making quiet sounds louder and loud sounds quieter. 
It offers flexible attack/release, knee, ratio, lookahead, and sidechain EQ.

## Parameter Groups
- **Threshold** — Level where compression starts.
- **Ratio** — Amount of gain reduction applied.
- **Attack/Release** — Response times of compression.
- **Knee** — Soft vs hard knee behavior.
- **Makeup Gain** — Compensates for reduced level.
- **Lookahead** — Anticipates peaks for smoother control.
- **Envelope Modes** — Peak, RMS, Expand.
- **Sidechain Section** — External input, EQ, HP/LP filter, gain.
- **Display** — Real-time gain reduction and envelope metering.

## Workflows
- **Glue vocals**: Ratio 3:1, soft knee, medium attack, fast release.
- **Drum punch**: fast attack, medium release, Ratio 4–6:1.
- **Bus control**: RMS mode, soft knee, Ratio 2:1.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release to primary encoders.
- Use sidechain enable and HP/LP for ducking setups.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Too fast attack can kill transients.
- Lookahead increases latency slightly; disable if not needed.
