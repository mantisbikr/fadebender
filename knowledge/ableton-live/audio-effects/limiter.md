# Ableton Live 12 — Limiter

## Overview
Limiter ensures output never exceeds the ceiling, preventing clipping and protecting speakers.

## Parameter Groups
- **Ceiling** — Maximum output level.
- **Gain** — Input gain before limiting.
- **Lookahead** — Anticipates peaks for transparency.
- **Release** — Timing of return after limiting.
- **Metering** — Visual feedback of gain reduction.

## Workflows
- Final stage on master bus to prevent clipping.
- Catch peaks on live performance inputs.
- Use with moderate Gain to increase loudness safely.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Gain and Ceiling for fast live control.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Too much Gain reduces dynamics; use sparingly.
- Lookahead adds latency; set short for live, long for mastering.
