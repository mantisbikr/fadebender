# Ableton Live 12 — Redux

## Overview
Redux emulates vintage digital distortion by reducing bit depth and sample rate. 
It includes jitter and shaping controls for more varied lo-fi textures.

## Parameter Groups
- **Bit Reduction** — Lowers bit depth for quantization noise.
- **Sample Rate Reduction** — Downsamples audio for aliasing/graininess.
- **Jitter** — Randomizes sample timing for instability.
- **Shaping** — Alters distortion curve.
- **Filters** — HP/LP post-filtering.
- **Dry/Wet** — Blend.

## Workflows
- Add grit to drums with mild bit reduction.
- Lo-fi effect on full mixes by reducing sample rate.
- Experimental sound design with jitter and shaping.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Bit Reduction and Sample Rate for classic bitcrusher play.
- Use Dry/Wet to balance subtlety.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Extreme reduction can destroy transients — automate for effect.
- CPU-light, but aliasing is inherent.
