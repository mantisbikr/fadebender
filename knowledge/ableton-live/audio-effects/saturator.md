# Ableton Live 12 — Saturator

## Overview
Saturator applies harmonic distortion using waveshaping. It features multiple curve types, 
analog clip, and soft/hard saturation.

## Parameter Groups
- **Drive** — Amount of harmonic distortion.
- **Curve Types** — Analog Clip, Soft Sine, Hard Curve, etc.
- **Base/Width** — Adjust distortion curve.
- **Output/Color** — Adjust final tone and gain.
- **DC/Color Filters** — Pre/post filtering options.
- **Dry/Wet** — Balance.

## Workflows
- Warm up vocals or synths with Soft Sine curve.
- Add edge to drums with Hard Curve.
- Creative sound design with extreme Drive and Width.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Drive, Curve, Output for core control.
- Dry/Wet for parallel saturation.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Watch Output level; saturation increases gain.
- Hi-Quality mode increases CPU but improves aliasing.
