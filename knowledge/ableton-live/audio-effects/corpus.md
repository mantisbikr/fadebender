# Ableton Live 12 — Corpus

## Overview
Corpus uses physical modeling to add resonant characteristics of acoustic objects to audio. 
It can simulate membranes, tubes, plates, or strings.

## Parameter Groups
- **Resonator Type** — Membrane, Beam, String, Pipe, Plate, Tube, Marimba.
- **Tune/Decay** — Pitch and decay time of the resonator.
- **Material** — Changes harmonic profile.
- **Radius/Geometry** — Alters resonance size/shape.
- **Inharmonics** — Adds non-harmonic content.
- **Hit/Excite** — Adjusts excitation model.
- **Mix** — Dry/Wet blend.

## Workflows
- Add metallic timbre to percussion.
- Simulate tuned resonators for melodic FX.
- Transform simple drum loops into tonal material.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Type, Tune, Decay, Material for sound design performance.
- Use Mix to control subtle vs extreme coloration.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- CPU-heavy with long Decays; automate bypass when not needed.
