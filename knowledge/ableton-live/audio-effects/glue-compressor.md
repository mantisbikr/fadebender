# Ableton Live 12 — Glue Compressor

## Overview
Glue Compressor emulates the SSL bus compressor, providing punch and cohesion for groups or the master bus.

## Parameter Groups
- **Threshold** — Level at which compression begins.
- **Ratio** — Fixed options: 2:1, 4:1, 10:1.
- **Attack/Release** — Selectable timing ranges.
- **Makeup Gain** — Compensates for reduced output level.
- **Range** — Limits maximum gain reduction applied.
- **Soft Clip** — Analog-style saturation stage.
- **Dry/Wet** — Built-in parallel compression.

## Workflows
- Glue drum bus: Threshold low, Ratio 4:1, medium attack, auto release.
- Mix bus: Ratio 2:1, slow attack, auto release, subtle gain reduction.
- Parallel compression with Dry/Wet blend.

## Mapping Notes
- Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release = core controls.
- Map Dry/Wet for instant parallel processing.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Use Range to avoid over-compression.
- Soft Clip adds harmonics but can distort if driven hard.
