# Ableton Live 12 — Vocoder

## Overview
Vocoder uses one signal to impose spectral information (modulator) onto another (carrier). 
This creates robotic, harmonic, or synthetic speech-like textures.

## Parameter Groups
- **Carrier** — Noise, external input, or internal synth.
- **Bands** — Number of frequency bands (4–40).
- **Formant Shift** — Moves spectral envelope.
- **Depth** — Amount of modulation applied.
- **Release** — Decay time of bands.
- **Unvoiced** — Adds noise for consonant clarity.
- **Enhance** — Widens or brightens effect.
- **Dry/Wet** — Blend.

## Workflows
- Classic robotic vocals using voice as modulator, noise as carrier.
- Add texture to drums by vocoding with synth pads.
- Harmonic FX with external carrier.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Carrier, Bands, Formant, Dry/Wet for expressive control.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Low band count = lo-fi effect; high band count = detailed but CPU-heavy.
- Ensure modulator input level is strong for clarity.
