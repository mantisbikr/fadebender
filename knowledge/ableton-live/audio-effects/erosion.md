# Ableton Live 12 — Erosion

## Overview
Erosion degrades audio by adding noise or digital-like artifacts. 
It’s useful for lo-fi textures or gritty edge.

## Parameter Groups
- **Mode** — Sine, Noise, or Wide Noise.
- **Frequency** — Center frequency of erosion effect.
- **Width** — Bandwidth of noise (for Noise modes).
- **Amount** — Depth of applied effect.
- **Dry/Wet** — Blend processed and original.

## Workflows
- Add grit to drums with Noise mode around 6–8 kHz.
- Use Sine mode tuned to harmonics for metallic textures.
- Lo-fi effect on synths with high Amount.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Frequency and Amount to knobs for live manipulation.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- High Amount can overwhelm; use sparingly.
- CPU-light, but additive distortion may clip — watch levels.
