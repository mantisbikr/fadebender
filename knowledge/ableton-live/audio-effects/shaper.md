# Ableton Live 12 — Shaper

## Overview
Shaper modulates an audio signal’s amplitude, panning, or other parameters using custom drawable curves. 
It provides tempo sync, variable resolution, and multiple wave shapes.

## Parameter Groups
- **Waveform Editor** — Draw or edit modulation curve.
- **Rate** — Sync to tempo or run free in Hz.
- **Depth/Amount** — Intensity of modulation.
- **Phase/Offset** — Shift modulation start point.
- **Smoothing** — Controls interpolation of drawn curves.
- **Dry/Wet** — Blend.

## Workflows
- Create rhythmic gating by drawing custom curves.
- Complex tremolo or autopan effects synced to tempo.
- Experimental modulation for glitchy textures.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Depth and Rate for performance control.
- Use curve presets for fast recall.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- High-resolution curves may increase CPU.
- Use smoothing to reduce clicks.
