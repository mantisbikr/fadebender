# Ableton Live 12 — Roar

## Overview
Roar is a powerful new distortion/saturation device in Live 12. It provides multi-stage drive, 
feedback routing, and flexible modulation for sound design.

## Parameter Groups
- **Drive Section** — Multiple distortion algorithms and gain controls.
- **Filter Section** — Pre/post filters for tone shaping.
- **Feedback** — Routes output back for resonant distortion.
- **Modulation** — LFOs and envelopes for parameter modulation.
- **Routing Modes** — Single, Multi, Mid/Side, or Parallel.
- **Output** — Final gain and Dry/Wet.

## Workflows
- Aggressive bass distortion with feedback engaged.
- Multi-band saturation for mastering-style color.
- Experimental modulation with LFOs/envelopes.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Drive, Feedback, Filter Freq for performance FX.
- Routing toggle for dramatic tone changes.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Feedback can easily overload — monitor levels carefully.
- CPU use is higher than Saturator/Overdrive; freeze tracks if needed.
