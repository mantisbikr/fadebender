# Ableton Live 12 — Chorus-Ensemble

## Overview
Chorus-Ensemble uses modulated short delays to create width and richness.
It offers multiple voices and modes for subtle chorus to lush ensemble effects.

## Parameter Groups
- **Mode Selector** — Chorus (2‑voice) or Ensemble (6‑voice).
- **Amount** — Modulation depth.
- **Rate** — Modulation speed (Hz or synced).
- **Delay** — Base delay time of voices.
- **Spread** — Stereo width of modulation.
- **Output** — Level trim.
- **Dry/Wet** — Balance dry vs effect.

## Workflows
- **Subtle width**: Chorus mode, low Amount, slow Rate.
- **Lush pads**: Ensemble mode, medium Delay, Spread high.
- **Bass chorus**: keep Delay low to avoid phasey lows.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Amount, Rate, Spread for live performance.
- Mode toggle can be macro‑assigned for quick switching.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Too much Amount/Rate can create seasick effect — keep moderate.
- Ensemble uses more CPU than Chorus.
