# Ableton Live 12 — Spectrum

## Overview
Spectrum analyzes and displays the frequency spectrum of incoming audio. 
It is a visual tool for mixing and sound design decisions.

## Parameter Groups
- **Block Size** — FFT window size (resolution vs CPU).
- **Refresh Rate** — Update speed of display.
- **Scale** — Linear or logarithmic frequency scaling.
- **Range** — dB range of display.
- **Tilt** — Adjusts emphasis on highs vs lows.

## Workflows
- Identify resonant peaks for EQing.
- Compare tonal balance across tracks.
- Visualize stereo or mid/side differences.

## Mapping Notes
- Typically not mapped; used as visual tool.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Larger Block Size = higher resolution but more latency/CPU.
- Use Tilt to match perceived loudness across spectrum.
