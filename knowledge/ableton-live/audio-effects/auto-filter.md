# Ableton Live 12 — Auto Filter

## Overview
Auto Filter applies resonant filtering (LP, HP, BP, notch) modulated by an envelope
follower, LFO, or external sidechain input.

## Parameter Groups
- **Filter Type** — Low‑pass, high‑pass, band‑pass, notch.
- **Cutoff** — Main frequency control.
- **Resonance (Q)** — Sharpness of filter peak.
- **Envelope** — Follower with amount, attack, release; reacts to input or sidechain.
- **LFO** — Waveform, rate (Hz or sync), amount, phase, spin.
- **Drive** — Adds filter saturation.
- **Sidechain Section** — Source selector, gain, EQ for key input.

## Workflows
- Classic **auto‑wah**: band‑pass + envelope follower on guitar/keys.
- **Sidechain filter**: duck or emphasize frequencies based on kick input.
- **Rhythmic sweeps**: tempo‑synced LFO.

## Mapping Notes
- Map **Cutoff** and **Resonance** to primary encoders.
- Use macros for switching filter type and LFO waveform.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- High resonance can clip — adjust Drive and Output carefully.
- CPU: disable unused LFO or sidechain to save cycles.
