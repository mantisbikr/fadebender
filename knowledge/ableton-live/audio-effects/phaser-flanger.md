# Ableton Live 12 — Phaser-Flanger

## Overview
Phaser-Flanger combines the classic phaser and flanger effects into one device. 
It uses modulated phase cancellation to create movement and depth.

## Parameter Groups
- **Mode** — Phaser or Flanger.
- **Poles/Delay** — Control number of notches (phaser) or delay time (flanger).
- **Feedback** — Amount of signal fed back for resonance.
- **Modulation** — LFO rate, amount, phase, offset.
- **Spread** — Stereo width control.
- **Dry/Wet** — Blend.

## Workflows
- Phaser mode for subtle movement on pads.
- Flanger mode for metallic sweeps on guitars.
- Extreme feedback for resonant sound design.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Mode, Feedback, Rate, Amount for live tweaking.
- Spread for stereo enhancement.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- High Feedback can cause ringing; adjust carefully.
- Phaser uses less CPU than Flanger with high modulation depth.
