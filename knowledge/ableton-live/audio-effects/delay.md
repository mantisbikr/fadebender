# Ableton Live 12 — Delay

## Overview
The **Delay** effect provides two **independent delay lines** (left/right). Each can be synced to tempo or set freely in milliseconds. Includes feedback, filters, ping-pong routing, and modulation features for creative echo design.

---

## Signal Flow
Input → Split L/R → Delay Time (sync/ms) → Feedback loop (with filter + ping pong) → Modulation → Output (Dry/Wet)

---

## Parameter Groups

- **Time & Sync**
  - **Sync** toggle — switch between beat divisions and ms.
  - **Delay Time knobs** — ms or rhythmic divisions (16ths, dotted, triplets).
  - **Repitch / Fade mode** — Repitch creates tape-style pitch shifts when changing time; Fade crossfades smoothly.

- **Feedback**
  - Controls the amount of output fed back into the input.
  - At high values, produces infinite echoes (watch levels).

- **Filter Section**
  - High-pass / low-pass filters shape the repeats.
  - Prevents buildup of lows or harsh highs.

- **Ping Pong**
  - Crossfeeds signal between L/R delays for a stereo bouncing effect.

- **Modulation**
  - Add random variation/noise or wobble to delay times for analog/tape feel.

- **Output**
  - **Dry/Wet** — set to 100% on return tracks.
  - **Output gain** for balancing processed signal.

## Practical Workflows

- **Vocal Slapback:** Sync off, Time ~80–120 ms, low Feedback, modest Dry/Wet.
- **Dub Delay:** Sync on, 1/8 or 1/16 notes, high Feedback, modulated filter sweep.
- **Wide Ping Pong:** Ping Pong On, medium Feedback, tempo-synced values on L/R.
- **Tape Echo Emulation:** Repitch On, moderate modulation, filter high cut.

## Controller/Remote Mapping Notes

1. **Core Page:** Delay Time L, Delay Time R, Sync, Repitch/Fade, Feedback, Dry/Wet.
2. **Tone Page:** Filter HP/LP controls, Ping Pong toggle.
3. **Mod Page:** Noise Amount, Mod Rate/Depth.

## Tips (from 24.11.1)

- Use **high feedback carefully**; combine with filters to avoid muddiness.
- **Repitch** = tape/vinyl artifacts; **Fade** = seamless performance-safe changes.
- For creative effects, automate **Sync toggle** or **switch between divisions**.
- Combine with **Reverb** (post-delay) for spacious echoes.
