# Ableton Live 12 — Overdrive

## Overview
Overdrive adds harmonic distortion by simulating analog saturation. 
It emphasizes frequencies within a selectable band.

## Parameter Groups
- **Band Selector** — Focus distortion on a frequency range.
- **Drive** — Amount of saturation applied.
- **Tone** — Adjusts brightness/darkness of distortion.
- **Dynamics** — Controls how input dynamics affect drive.
- **Level** — Output gain.
- **Dry/Wet** — Blend.

## Workflows
- Add grit to synth leads by focusing drive on mids.
- Warm up vocals with low drive, darker tone.
- Extreme drive for lo-fi character on drums.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Drive, Tone, Band for expressive use.
- Dry/Wet for subtle vs full saturation.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- High Drive may clip; adjust Level accordingly.
- Band Selector helps target distortion where needed.
