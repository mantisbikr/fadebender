# Ableton Live 12 — Gate

## Overview
Gate silences or reduces audio when the input level drops below a threshold. 
It is useful for cleaning up recordings, isolating hits, or shaping transients.

## Parameter Groups
- **Threshold** — Level where gate opens/closes.
- **Return** — Hysteresis; prevents chatter by requiring higher level to reopen.
- **Attack/Hold/Release** — Timing controls for gate behavior.
- **Floor** — Attenuation amount for closed state.
- **Sidechain Section** — External input, EQ filter, gain for triggering.

## Workflows
- Clean up vocal tracks by gating out room noise.
- Tighten drums by removing bleed between mics.
- Creative chopping effect with extreme settings.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Threshold, Attack, Release for fast access.
- Sidechain enable and filter for external keying.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Too fast release can cause clicks.
- Use Return to stabilize gate action.
