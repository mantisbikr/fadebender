# Ableton Live 12 — Frequency Shifter

## Overview
Frequency Shifter moves all spectral components by a fixed frequency amount, 
producing metallic or inharmonic results. It also includes ring modulation mode.

## Parameter Groups
- **Shift** — Amount of frequency shift in Hz.
- **Fine** — Fine adjustment in tenths of Hz.
- **Mode** — Frequency Shift or Ring Modulation.
- **LFO** — Waveform, rate, amount, phase, spin.
- **Mix** — Dry/Wet balance.

## Workflows
- Metallic textures by shifting small amounts (1–10 Hz).
- Inharmonic effects with large shifts.
- Use Ring Mod for tremolo-like AM effects at low frequencies.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Shift and LFO Rate/Amount for live FX.
- Mode toggle for instant change between shift/ring mod.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Large shifts can produce extreme artifacts — use mix to tame.
- CPU-light; safe for multiple instances.
