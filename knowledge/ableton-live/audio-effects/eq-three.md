# Ableton Live 12 — EQ Three

## Overview
EQ Three is optimized for DJ-style mixing. It splits audio into low, mid, and high bands 
with steep crossover slopes and individual gain control.

## Parameter Groups
- **Gain Knobs** — Low, Mid, High band gain (boost/cut).
- **Kill Switches** — Instantly mute any band.
- **Crossover Frequencies** — Define split points between bands.
- **Mode** — Adjust isolation curve shape.

## Workflows
- Isolate vocals by cutting Low and High bands.
- DJ-style drops with Kill switches.
- Shape stems quickly in live performance.

## Mapping Notes
- Map band gains to performance knobs/faders.
- Kill switches to buttons for live triggering.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Steep crossovers can cause phase coloration; use EQ Eight for transparent EQ.
