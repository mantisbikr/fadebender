# Ableton Live 12 — Amp

## Overview
Amp provides modeled sounds of seven classic guitar/bass amps. It shapes tone with
drive, EQ (bass, mid, treble, presence), and output balance.

## Parameter Groups
- **Amp Model Selector** — Seven styles: Clean, Boost, Blues, Rock, Lead, Heavy, Bass.
- **Gain** — Input drive; higher = more distortion/saturation.
- **Bass/Mid/Treble** — Three‑band EQ shaping.
- **Presence** — High‑frequency contour.
- **Output** — Output level control.
- **Dry/Wet** — Balance between dry and processed signals.

## Workflows
- Use with **Cabinet** for realistic guitar/bass sounds.
- Place after synths/drums for coloration/distortion.
- Automate **amp model** to morph tones in a performance.

## Mapping Notes
- Core controls: Gain, Bass, Mid, Treble, Presence, Output, Dry/Wet.
- Map amp model to a macro for quick switching.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- High Gain can overload; lower Output to prevent clipping.
- Use Dry/Wet < 100% for subtle coloration on non‑guitar material.
