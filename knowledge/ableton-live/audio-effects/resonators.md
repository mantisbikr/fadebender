# Ableton Live 12 — Resonators

## Overview
Resonators filter audio through five parallel tuned resonators, each with pitch, decay, and level controls. 
They can reinforce harmonics or add pitched layers.

## Parameter Groups
- **Resonator Pitches** — Five tunable notes (semitones).
- **Decay** — Length of each resonator’s ring.
- **Level** — Output per resonator.
- **Global Controls** — Root note, scale, global decay.
- **Filter** — Pre-filter for input shaping.
- **Dry/Wet** — Balance.

## Workflows
- Add tuned harmonics to drums.
- Create harmonic drones from noise.
- Reinforce melodies by matching resonator pitches.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Decay and Levels of resonators for performance control.
- Root and Scale for harmonic changes.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Too many resonances can clutter mix — moderate levels.
- Works best with percussive or noisy input.
