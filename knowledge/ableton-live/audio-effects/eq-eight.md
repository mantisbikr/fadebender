# Ableton Live 12 — EQ Eight

## Overview
EQ Eight provides up to eight fully parametric bands for detailed tonal shaping. 
It supports multiple filter types, oversampling, and mid/side or stereo operation.

## Parameter Groups
- **Bands (1–8)** — Enable/disable individual EQ bands.
- **Filter Types** — Low-pass, high-pass, bell, notch, shelving, etc.
- **Frequency, Gain, Q** — Per-band controls for shaping.
- **Mode** — Stereo, L/R, or Mid/Side processing.
- **Oversampling** — High-quality mode for reducing aliasing.
- **Global Controls** — Scale, Gain, Adaptive-Q.

## Workflows
- Surgical EQ for problem frequencies.
- Mid/Side EQ for widening/narrowing stereo image.
- Resonant filter sweeps for creative sound design.

## Mapping Notes
- Map band frequencies/gains to macros for DJ EQ style.
- Enable/disable bands via controller buttons.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Oversampling uses more CPU; disable if not critical.
- Narrow Q boosts can cause ringing; use moderation.
