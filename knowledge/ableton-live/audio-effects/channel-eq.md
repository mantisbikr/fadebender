# Ableton Live 12 — Channel EQ

## Overview
Channel EQ provides fast, broad tonal adjustments with three bands (low shelf,
mid bell, high shelf). Designed for quick mix corrections.

## Parameter Groups
- **Low Shelf** — Boost/cut bass frequencies.
- **Mid Bell** — Sweepable midrange control.
- **High Shelf** — Boost/cut treble frequencies.
- **Gain/Q** — Adjust gain and width per band (simplified vs EQ Eight).
- **Output** — Final level trim.

## Workflows
- Quick mix balancing on individual channels.
- Broad strokes on groups/buses.
- Simple EQing for live sets with minimal CPU.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Low/Mid/High gains to macros.
- Use Output for level matching after EQ moves.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- For surgical EQing, use EQ Eight instead.
- Minimal CPU use; safe for many tracks.
