# Ableton Live 12 — Beat Repeat

## Overview
Beat Repeat records short audio snippets and retriggers them at rhythmic intervals.
It can create subtle variations, fills, or extreme glitch effects.

## Parameter Groups
- **Interval** — How often repeats are triggered (in synced note values).
- **Offset** — Shifts timing of repeats relative to grid.
- **Chance** — Probability a repeat will occur (0–100%).
- **Grid** — Size of repeated slice (e.g., 1/16, 1/8).
- **Variation** — Randomize grid size for humanization.
- **Pitch** — Transpose repeats up/down in semitones.
- **Decay** — Volume decay per repeat cycle.
- **Mix Mode** — Insert, Mix, or Gate (determines how repeats replace/dovetail input).
- **Filter Section** — HP/LP filter applied to repeats only.

## Workflows
- **Fill generator**: set Interval = 1 bar, Chance = 20%.
- **Glitch stutter**: Grid = 1/32, high Chance, short Decay.
- **Live fills**: trigger with automation/macro mappings.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Interval, Chance, Grid to performance knobs.
- Use Mix Mode toggle for quick creative changes.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Keep Chance < 30% for subtlety.
- Gate mode can mute dry signal if repeats are infrequent.
