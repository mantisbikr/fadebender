# Ableton Live 12 — Multiband Dynamics

## Overview
Multiband Dynamics allows independent dynamics processing on low, mid, and high frequency bands. 
Each band can compress or expand signals with adjustable thresholds and ratios.

## Parameter Groups
- **Bands** — Low, Mid, High with adjustable crossovers.
- **Thresholds** — Upper and lower per band for compression/expansion.
- **Ratios** — Control strength of compression/expansion.
- **Attack/Release** — Response times per band.
- **Output Gains** — Make-up gain for each band.
- **Global Controls** — Time, Amount, Output, Soft Knee, Sidechain.

## Workflows
- Mastering: tighten lows, smooth mids, add presence to highs.
- Creative: expand highs for brightness, compress mids for control.
- De-essing: compress only high band.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Amount and Band gains for broad control.
- Use macros to toggle bands on/off.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Complex device; start with presets.
- High ratios can distort if thresholds are too low.
