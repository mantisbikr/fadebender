# Ableton Live 12 — Grain Delay

## Overview
Grain Delay applies delay and feedback on audio grains, adding pitch and time modulation for experimental effects.

## Parameter Groups
- **Delay Time** — Sets time per grain (ms or sync).
- **Pitch** — Shifts pitch of grains in semitones.
- **Feedback** — Amount of signal fed back.
- **Random Pitch** — Adds random variation to grain pitch.
- **Frequency** — Modulates grain timing for comb-like textures.
- **Dry/Wet** — Blend processed signal.

## Workflows
- Shimmer-like effects with pitched feedback.
- Randomized textures on percussion.
- Metallic resonances with Frequency modulation.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Pitch and Feedback for expressive play.
- Random Pitch for live unpredictability.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- High Feedback can self-oscillate; monitor carefully.
- Grain processing can smear transients; use creatively.
