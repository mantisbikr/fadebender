# Ableton Live 12 — Filter Delay

## Overview
Filter Delay applies three independent delays to low, mid, and high frequency bands. 
Each has its own feedback, filter, and panning.

## Parameter Groups
- **Delay Lines** — Three (low, mid, high), each with time and feedback controls.
- **Filters** — Adjustable HP/LP filters per band.
- **Pan** — Position each band in stereo field.
- **Volume** — Level per delay line.
- **Dry/Wet** — Overall mix.

## Workflows
- Create dub-style echoes with frequency separation.
- Spread stereo field by panning bands differently.
- Rhythmic filtering with synced delays.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Delay Times and Feedbacks for each band.
- Pan controls for live stereo manipulation.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- High feedback can self-oscillate; manage levels carefully.
- CPU: minimal, but three lines can add up in complex sets.
