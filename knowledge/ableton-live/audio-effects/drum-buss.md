# Ableton Live 12 — Drum Buss

## Overview
Drum Buss shapes drum sounds with drive, transient control, compression, and sub-bass. 
It can glue drums together or add punch and weight.

## Parameter Groups
- **Drive** — Adds analog-style saturation.
- **Crunch** — Distortion emphasizing mid frequencies.
- **Boom** — Resonant low-end enhancer with frequency control.
- **Damp** — High-frequency damping filter.
- **Transient** — Adjust attack or sustain emphasis.
- **Comp** — Simple compressor for glue.
- **Output** — Final level.
- **Dry/Wet** — Blend.

## Workflows
- Add punch to acoustic drums (increase Transient, moderate Drive).
- Glue electronic kits with Comp and Crunch.
- Enhance kick weight with Boom tuned to track key.

## Mapping Notes
- Map Drive, Boom, Transient for live tweaking.
- Dry/Wet for parallel drum effects.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- Boom can overwhelm mix — monitor low end.
- Use Damp to tame harshness from Drive/Crunch.
