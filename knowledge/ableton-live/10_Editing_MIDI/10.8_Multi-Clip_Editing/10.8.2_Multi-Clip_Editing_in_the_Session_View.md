# 10.8.2 Multi-Clip Editing in the Session View

In the Session View, you can select and view up to eight MIDI clips at the same time, all of which must
be looped. In the MIDI Note Editor, loop bars are ordered vertically (first by track, and then by
scene).

If multiple clips of different lengths are selected, the MIDI Note Editor will show as many loop
iterations as necessary for the clips to realign. The part of the timeline that falls outside of a clip’s loop
area will be marked in a darker version of the clip color. When you hover over a clip, loop start and
end will be represented by black vertical lines in the MIDI Note Editor. If a clip’s start marker is set
before the loop start, the loop markers for the clip will be shifted accordingly to represent this.
