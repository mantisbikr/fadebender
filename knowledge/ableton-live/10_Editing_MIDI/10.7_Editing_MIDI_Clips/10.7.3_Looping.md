# 10.7.3 Looping

When editing MIDI, you might find that you want to loop a specific portion of a clip in order to make
fine adjustments while listening to the section repeatedly. You can use the loop markers for this.

You can select a region for looping by moving the position of the loop start and end markers. Note
that it is possible to adjust the looping region during playback.

Use the Loop/Region Markers to Select a Specific Region of the Clip to Play.

Selecting the loop brace in a MIDI clip and pressing Ctrl
the length of the loop brace, duplicates the notes contained within the original loop brace, and zooms
out as necessary to show the entire loop. Any notes to the right of the loop will be moved, so that they
maintain their position relative to the end of the loop.

MIDI clips are looped by default. You can turn off looping for an individual clip using the Clip Loop
toggle in the Clip View’s Main Clip Properties panel. When looping is switched off, the loop brace is
grayed out.
