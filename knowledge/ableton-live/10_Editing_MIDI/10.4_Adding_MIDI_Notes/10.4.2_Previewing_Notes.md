# 10.4.2 Previewing Notes

As long as your MIDI track’s device chain contains an instrument, activating the Preview switch in the
MIDI Editor allows you to hear notes as you add them or select and move existing notes. If the MIDI
track is armed, activating Preview also allows you to step record new notes into the clip. Note that the
Preview switch’s on/off state applies to all MIDI tracks in the Live Set.
