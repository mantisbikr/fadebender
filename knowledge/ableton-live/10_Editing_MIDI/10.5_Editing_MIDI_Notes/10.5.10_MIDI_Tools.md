# 10.5.10 MIDI Tools

The MIDI Tools contained in the Transform and Generate panels offer additional ways of editing MIDI
notes. Existing notes can be altered through, amongst others, articulation, interpolation, or
ornamentation, or completely new note patterns can be instantly generated according to specified
parameters.

You can find out more about all the available options for transforming and generating notes in a
dedicated MIDI Tools chapter.
