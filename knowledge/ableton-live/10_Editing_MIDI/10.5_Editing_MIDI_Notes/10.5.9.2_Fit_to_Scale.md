# 10.5.9.2 Fit to Scale

The Fit to Scale button adjusts pitches of the notes within the clip or the selection so that they fall within
the scale set for the clip. Notes are adjusted to the closest scale degree of a given scale or, in case of
an equal distance, to the lower scale degree. If a scale is not active for the clip, the button will be
greyed out.
