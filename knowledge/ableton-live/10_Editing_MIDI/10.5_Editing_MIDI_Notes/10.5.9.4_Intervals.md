# 10.5.9.4 Intervals

You can use the Interval Size slider and the Add Interval button to set the number of semitones or
scale degrees (if a clip scale is active) by which the pitches of new notes will be shifted in relation to
the pitches of the original note selection. This is useful for quickly creating chords.

If there is an existing note selection, adjusting the value in the Interval Size slider will result in new
notes being immediately added and selected in the MIDI Note Editor. When no notes are selected,
the slider merely sets the interval size which then needs to be applied with the Add Interval button. If
the button is then used with no note selection, new notes will be added at the specified interval for all
of the existing notes in the clip.
