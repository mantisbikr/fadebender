# 10.5.9.6 Note Duration

You can set the same note duration, or length, for all selected notes. It is possible to fit note lengths
within time range, use the current grid setting as the basis for note duration, or select a specific length
from the options available in the Duration drop-down menu.

Once you select the desired note length, apply it to the selected notes with the Set Length button. If no
notes are selected, pressing the button will apply the specified note length to all notes in the clip.
