# 10.5.9.3 Invert

Invert is a pitch operation where the position of the highest note is swapped with the position of the
lowest note, with other notes being flipped vertically, resulting in the note selection being turned
“upside-down”.

The Invert Button.

If a scale is active in the clip, Invert will calculate the inverse position of notes relative to the current
scale degrees.

Note: Invert is not to be confused with the Invert Selection option described in the Selecting Notes
and Timespan section earlier in this chapter: the former is a pitch change performed on a note
selection, whereas the latter changes what is selected.
