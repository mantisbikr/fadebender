# 10.5.9.5 Stretch

It is possible to quickly adjust the note length of selected notes with the three note stretching options in
the Pitch and Time Utilities panel: the Stretch Factor control and the Double (×2) and Halve (/2)
buttons.

Stretch sets the factor by which the note length is changed. The ×2 and /2 buttons to the right of the
Stretch control respectively extend or shorten the note duration, time selection, or loop region by a
factor of 2.

Note Stretching Options.

Note that the Stretch control has no effect on the length of the loop region.
