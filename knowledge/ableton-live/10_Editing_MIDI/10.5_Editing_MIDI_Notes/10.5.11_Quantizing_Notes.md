# 10.5.11 Quantizing Notes

There are four ways of quantizing MIDI notes in Live:

1.
2.
3.

Quantizing notes as you record them.
Quantizing notes by moving them so that they snap to the visible grid lines.
Quantizing notes by using the Quantize MIDI Tool in Clip View’s Transform panel for more
granular control of note quantization. The transformation allows you to set a specific value at
which notes will be quantized (including the possibility of note starts and ends being

quantized). You can also quantize notes without giving them that “quantized” feel using the
Amount control, which will move notes only by a percentage of the set quantization value.

The Quantize MIDI Tool.

4.

Quantizing by selecting a note or notes and choosing the Quantize command from the Edit
menu, or using the Ctrl
U (Mac) keyboard shortcut. This option will use
the quantization settings as specified in the Quantize MIDI Tool described above. These settings
can also be opened using the Ctrl
U (Mac) keyboard
shortcut.
