# 10.5.1 Non-Destructive Editing

You can always return your MIDI clip to its previous state by using the Edit menu’s Undo command.
Furthermore, if the MIDI clip being edited originated in a MIDI file on your hard drive, none of your
editing will alter the original MIDI file, as Live incorporates its contents into your Live Set when
importing.
