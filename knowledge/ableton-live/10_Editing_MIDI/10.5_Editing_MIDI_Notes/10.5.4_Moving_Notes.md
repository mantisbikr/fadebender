# 10.5.4 Moving Notes

Notes in the MIDI Note Editor can be moved both horizontally (changing their position in time) and
vertically (changing their transposition). They can be moved either by clicking and dragging, or with
the arrow keys on your computer keyboard. Notes will react to grid snapping unless the grid is off. To
nudge notes without snapping to the grid, hold Alt (Win) / Cmd (Mac) and press the left or right
arrow keys.

When notes are selected, you can use the Edit menu to perform editing actions on the notes, such as
Copy and Paste. Notes in the clipboard will be pasted starting at the location of the insert marker. You
can also use the Ctrl (Win) / Option (Mac) modifier to click and drag copies of notes to a new
location. If you click and drag to move notes but then decide that you would like to copy them
instead, you can press Ctrl (Win) / Option (Mac) even after you start dragging.

When editing or drawing, you may sometimes place a new note on top of one that already exists. If
the new note overlaps with the beginning of the original note, the original note will be overwritten. If
the new note overlaps with the end of the original, the original note will be shortened.
