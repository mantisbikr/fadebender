# 10.5.9.7 Humanize

Humanize adds a variation to note starts times, removing any potential mechanical feel from the
composition. The variation percentage is set using the Humanize Amount slider, up to a quarter of a
grid division before or after the original note position, and can be applied with the Humanize button.
