# 10.5.12.2 Note Off Velocity

While the Velocity Editor allows you to adjust Note On velocities, you can also open the Release
Velocity Editor to show Note Off velocities.

Select the Release Velocity Editor via the Lane Selector.

Note Off (or “release”) velocity is a somewhat esoteric parameter. If you think of velocity as the
speed of pressing a key, you can look at release velocity as the speed at which the pressed-down key

is released. Release velocity is only supported by certain devices. Live’s Sampler instrument, for
example, provides Note Off velocity as a controller for a variety of parameters.
