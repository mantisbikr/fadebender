# 10.2.2 Playback Options

The MIDI Note Editor can be set to scroll with playback using the Follow switch in the Control Bar.
Follow will pause if you make an edit in the MIDI Note Editor, and will start again when you press the
Follow switch again, when you stop and restart playback, or when you stop playback and click in the
scrub area in the clip or the Arrangement View.

The Control Bar’s Follow Switch.

When Permanent Scrub Areas is enabled in Live’s Display & Input Settings, clicking in the scrub area
below the beat-time ruler starts playback from that point, rounded by the global quantization setting.

Activating the Options menu’s Chase MIDI Notes command allows MIDI notes to play back even if
playback begins after the MIDI note’s start time.

When the Permanent Scrub Areas preference is off, you can still scrub by Shift -clicking anywhere
in the scrub area or in the beat-time ruler. Learning about looping and scrubbing clips, and the
shortcuts associated with these actions can also be helpful in getting around in the MIDI Note Editor
and playing selections quickly and easily.
