# 10.2.1 Grid Snapping

Most functions in the MIDI Note Editor are subject to grid snapping. This means that when you adjust
note positions, the grid acts as if it is magnetic: when you first move a note, it will move freely up to the
first grid line you encounter and afterwards, if you continue to drag the note, it will snap to grid lines
rather than move freely. You can bypass grid snapping by turning off the grid using the Grid Settings
button, by deactivating the Snap to Grid option in the Options menu, or by pressing the Ctrl
(Win) / Cmd

grid. This is useful for preserving a groove or loose playing style that you do not necessarily want to
