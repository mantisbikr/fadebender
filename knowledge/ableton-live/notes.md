# Ableton Live Notes (Concise)

## Devices

### EQ Eight
- Modes: Stereo/L/R/M/S, Mid/Side processing available.
- Use HPF on non-bass tracks; dynamic adjustments via automation or Utility.
- Oversampling trades CPU for quality at high boosts.

### Compressor
- Knee softens onset; lookahead tames fast peaks.
- Sidechain: enable, choose source, set HP/LP sidechain EQ for focused triggering.
- Glue Compressor: good for bus compression (1–4 dB GR, slow attack, auto release).

### Reverb
- Early reflections vs tail control clarity; pre-delay 10–25 ms for vocals.
- Dampen highs to avoid harsh tails; use sends to blend wet with dry.

### Utility
- Gain for trim; width control and mono for checks; phase flip for troubleshooting.

## Workflow
- Use Return tracks for verbs/delays; name Sends clearly (A: Verb, B: Delay).
- Organize tracks and color-code for navigation.
- Map critical parameters to MIDI for quick control.

## Common Tasks
- Sidechain: Add Compressor on target, enable Sidechain, choose source (e.g., Kick), adjust threshold/ratio.
- Vocal clarity: HPF ~80 Hz, subtract 200–400 Hz mud, gentle presence boost 3–5 kHz, de-ess 6–8 kHz.
