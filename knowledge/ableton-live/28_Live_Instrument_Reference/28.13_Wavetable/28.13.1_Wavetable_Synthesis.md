# 28.13.1 Wavetable Synthesis

Wavetable’s oscillators produce sound using a technique called wavetable synthesis. A wavetable is
simply an arbitrary collection of short, looping samples that are arranged together. Playing a note
with the oscillator fixed to just one of these samples will produce a steady tone with a consistent
timbre. But the real power of wavetable synthesis comes by moving between the various samples in
the table as the note plays, which results in a shifting timbre. Wavetable synthesis is extremely well-
suited for producing dynamic sounds that change over time.
