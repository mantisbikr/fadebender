# 28.13.3 Sub Oscillator

Wavetable’s Sub Oscillator.

In addition to the two main oscillators, Wavetable includes a sub oscillator. This can be toggled on or
off using the Sub toggle, and its output level is adjusted with the Gain knob.

The Tone control alters the timbre of the sub oscillator. At 0%, the oscillator produces a pure sine wave.
Turning Tone up increases the harmonic content of the waveform.

The tuning of the sub is determined by the played note and the global Transpose value, but you can
shift the sub down by one or two octaves using the Octave switches.
