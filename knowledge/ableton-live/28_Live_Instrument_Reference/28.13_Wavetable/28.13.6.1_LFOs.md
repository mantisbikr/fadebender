# 28.13.6.1 LFOs

Wavetable includes two LFOs, which can be adjusted individually via the parameters described in this
section.

Wavetable’s LFOs.

You can choose from one of five LFO waveforms, and use the Shape slider to modify the selected
waveform’s shape:

•
•
•
•

Sine and Saw: Applies an increasing or decreasing slope.
Triangle: Morphs the symmetry from Ramp to Saw, with Triangle in the middle.
Square: Changes the pulse width.
Random: Changes the distribution of extreme values.

The Sync switch sets the LFO Rate in Hertz or synced to the song tempo, while the Rate slider sets the
LFO frequency in Hertz or beat divisions. Note that you can also adjust the LFO frequency by
dragging the waveform display.

Amount adjusts the amount of LFO modulation that is applied to incoming signals. Note that this is a
multiplicative modulation destination.

The Offset slider offsets the phase of the LFO so that it starts at a different value. Note that Offset
cannot be modulated.

You can use the LFO Attack slider to adjust the time the LFO takes to fade in, when it has been
triggered by a Note On.

When enabled, the LFO Retrigger switch will cause the LFO to reset to its starting point, or initial
phase, on each new MIDI note. This can create hybrid LFO shapes if the LFO is retriggered before
completing a cycle.
