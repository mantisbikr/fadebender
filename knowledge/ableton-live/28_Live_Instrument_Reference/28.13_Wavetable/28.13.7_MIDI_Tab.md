# 28.13.7 MIDI Tab

Assigning MIDI to parameters can turn Wavetable into a dynamic performance instrument. Within the
MIDI Modulation Matrix, MIDI modulation sources can be assigned to multiple parameters within the
instrument (or “modulation targets”).

Wavetable’s MIDI Tab.

When Velocity is assigned, Wavetable will use the incoming MIDI note’s velocity value to modulate
target parameters for the duration of that note.

When Note is assigned, Wavetable will use the incoming MIDI note’s pitch to modulate target
parameters for the duration of that note. The pitch modulation range is centered around C3. This
means when it is assigned to Filter Frequency with the modulation amount set to 100%, the filter will
precisely track the played note.

Pitch Bend, Aftertouch and Modulation Wheel: these are hardware controls found on many MIDI
controller devices. If you do not have such a device, you can still modulate the parameters with clip
envelopes.

When Random is assigned, Wavetable will modulate target parameters by a random value, which is
calculated each time a note is triggered.

Click on a parameter in the instrument to make it appear temporarily in the matrix. If you apply
modulation to this parameter, it will remain in the matrix. If no modulation is applied, the parameter
will disappear from the matrix when you click another parameter. Note that the Matrix tab and MIDI
tab share the same rows.
