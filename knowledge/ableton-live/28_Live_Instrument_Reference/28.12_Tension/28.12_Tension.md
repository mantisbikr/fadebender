# 28.12 Tension

The Tension Instrument.

Tension is a synthesizer dedicated to the emulation of string instruments, and developed in
collaboration with Applied Acoustics Systems. The synthesizer is entirely based on physical modeling
technology and uses no sampling or wavetables. Instead, it produces sound by solving mathematical
equations that model the different components in string instruments and how they interact. This
elaborate synthesis engine responds dynamically to the control signals it receives while you play
thereby reproducing the richness and responsiveness of real string instruments.

Tension features four types of exciters (two types of hammer, a pick and a bow), an accurate model
of a string, a model of the fret/finger interaction, a damper model and different types of
soundboards. The combination of these different elements allows for the reproduction of a wide range
of string instruments. Tension is also equipped with filters, LFOs, envelope parameters, and MPE
support, which extend the sound sculpting possibilities beyond what would be possible with “real-
world“ instruments. Finally, Tension offers a wide range of performance features, including keyboard
modes, portamento, vibrato, and legato functions.

28.12.1 Architecture and Interface

It is the vibration from the string which constitutes the main sound production mechanism of the
instrument. The string is set into motion by the action of an exciter which can be a hammer, a pick or a
bow. The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the effective length of the string, which is
controlled by the finger/fret interaction or termination. A damper can be applied to the strings in
order to reduce the decay time of the oscillation. This is the case on a piano, for example, when felt is
applied to the strings by releasing the keys and sustain pedal. The vibration from the string is then
transmitted to the body of the instrument, which can radiate sound efficiently. In some instruments, the
string vibration is transmitted directly to the body through the bridge. In other instruments, such as the
electric guitar, a pickup is used to transmit the string vibration to an amplifier. In addition to these main

sections, a filter section has been included between the string and body sections in order to expand
the sonic possibilities of the instrument.

The Tension interface is divided into two main tabs, which are further divided into sections. The String
tab contains all of the fundamental sound producing components related to the string itself: Exciter,
Damper, String, Vibrato, Termination, Pickup, and Body. The Filter/Global tab contains the Filter
section and the MPE section, as well as controls for global performance parameters. Each section
(with the exception of String and the global Keyboard section) can be enabled or disabled
independently. Turning off a section reduces CPU usage.

28.12.2 String Tab

The String tab contains the parameters related to the physical properties of the string itself, as well as
the way in which it’s played.

28.12.2.1 The Exciter Section

Tension’s Exciter Section.

28.12.2.2 Exciter Types

The modeled string can be played using different types of exciters in order to reproduce different
types of instruments and playing techniques.

The Exciter section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. With it off, the string can
only be activated by interaction with its damper. If both the Exciter and Damper sections are
deactivated, nothing can set the string in motion — if you find that you’re not producing any sound,
check to see that at least one of these sections is on.

The Exciter Type chooser offers four choices - Bow, Hammer, Hammer (bouncing) and Plectrum.

Bow — this exciter is associated with bowed instruments such as the violin, viola or cello. The bow sets
the string in sustained oscillation. The motion of the bow hair across the string creates friction, causing
the string to alternate between sticking to the hair and breaking free. The frequency of this alternation
between sticking and slipping determines the fundamental pitch. Note that the Damping knob is
unavailable when the Bow exciter is selected.

Hammer — this exciter type simulates the behavior of soft hammers or mallets. Hammer models a
hammer that is located below the string and strikes it once before falling away. This type of
mechanism is found in a piano, for example.

Hammer (bouncing) - this exciter type is similar to Hammer, except that it models a hammer that is
located above the string and is dropped onto it, meaning that it can bounce on the string multiple
times. This playing mode can be found on a hammered dulcimer, for example.

Plectrum — a plectrum or “pick“ is associated with instruments such as guitars and harpsichords. It can
be thought of as an angled object placed under the string that snaps the string into motion.

28.12.2.3 Exciter Parameters

Next to the Exciter Type chooser are five parameter knobs. The first two parameters vary depending
on the chosen Exciter Type, whereas the last three parameters are universal.

Bow Parameters:

•

•

The Force knob adjusts the amount of pressure being applied to the string by the bow. The
sound becomes more “scratchy“ as you increase this value.
The Friction knob adjusts the amount of friction between the bow and the string. Higher values
usually result in a faster attack.

Hammer / Hammer (bouncing) Parameters:

•
•

The Mass knob adjusts the mass of the hammer.
The Stiffness knob adjusts the stiffness of the hammer’s surface area.

Plectrum Parameters:

•

•

The Protrusion knob adjusts how much of the plectrum’s surface area is placed under the string.
Lower values result in a “thinner,“ smaller sound, as there is less mass setting the string into
motion.
The Stiffness knob adjusts the stiffness of the plectrum.

Universal Exciter Parameters:

•
•

•

The Velocity knob adjusts the speed at which the exciter activates the string.
The Position knob specifies the point on the string where the exciter makes contact. At 0%, the
exciter contacts the string at its termination point, while at 50% it activates the string at its
midpoint. When the Fix. Pos switch (described in more detail below) is enabled, however, the
position is not dependent on the length of the string.
The Damping knob adjusts how much of the exciter’s impact force is absorbed back into the
exciter. Note: For the Hammer (bouncing) exciter, this is somewhat analogous to the Stiffness
parameter, but instead of controlling the stiffness of the hammer’s surface it adjusts the stiffness
of the virtual “spring“ that connects the hammer to the mass that powers it. As you increase the
Damping amount, the interaction between the hammer and string will become shorter,
generally resulting in a louder, brighter sound.

The Fix. Pos switch fixes the contact point to a single location, rather than changing as the length of the
string changes. This behavior is similar to that of a guitar, where the picking position is always
basically the same regardless of the notes being played. On a piano, the exciter position is relative —
the hammers normally strike the string at about 1/7th of their length — and so is best modeled with
Fix. Pos turned off.

Finally, the Vel and Key sliders allow you to modulate their behavior based on note velocity or pitch,
respectively.

Please note that the Exciter section’s parameters work closely together to influence the overall
behavior of the instrument. You may find that certain combinations of settings result in no sound at all.

28.12.2.4 The Damper Section

Tension’s Damper Section.

All string instruments employ some type of damping mechanism that mutes the resonating string. In
pianos, this is a felt pad that is applied to the string when the key is released. In instruments such as
guitars and violins, the player damps by stopping the string’s vibration with their fingers. Dampers
regulate the decay of strings but also produce some sound of their own, which is an important
characteristic of a string instrument’s timbre. The Damper section can be toggled on or off via the
switch next to its name.

Although a damper functions to mute the string rather than activate it, it is somewhat analogous to a
hammer, and shares some of the same parameters.

The Mass knob controls how hard the damper’s surface will press against the string. As you increase
the value, the string will mute more quickly.

The stiffness of the damper’s material is adjusted with the Stiffness control. Lower values simulate soft
materials such as felt, while higher values model a metal damper.

Note that very high Mass and Stiffness values can simulate dampers that connect with the string hard
enough to change its effective length, thus causing a change in tuning.

The Velocity control adjusts the speed with which the damper is applied to the string when the key is
released, as well as the speed with which it is lifted from the string when the key is depressed. Be
careful with this parameter — very high Velocity values can cause the damper to hit the string
extremely hard, which can result in a very loud sound on key release. Note that the state of the Gated
switch determines whether or not the Velocity control is enabled. When the Gated switch is turned on,

the damper is applied to the string when the key is released. With Gated off, the damper always
remains on the string, which means that the Velocity control has no effect.

The Position knob serves an analogous function to the control in the Exciter section, but here specifies
the point on the string where the damper makes contact. At 0%, the damper contacts the string at its
termination point, while at 50% it damps the string at its midpoint. The behavior is a bit different if the
Fix. Pos switch is enabled, however. In this case, the contact point is fixed to a single location, rather
than changing as the length of the string changes.

The Mass, Stiffness and Velocity, and Position parameters can be further modulated by note pitch
using the Key sliders below them.

The stiffness of the damper mechanism is adjusted with the Damping knob, which affects the overall
amount of vibration absorbed by the damper. Lower values result in less damping (longer decay
times). But this becomes a bit less predictable as the Damping value goes over 50%. At higher values,
the mechanism becomes so stiff that it bounces against the string. This in turn reduces the overall
amount of time that the damper is in contact with the string, causing an increase in decay time. The
best way to get a sense of how this parameter behaves is to gradually turn up the knob as you
repeatedly strike a single key.

The String Section

Tension’s String Section.

The vibration of the string is the main component of a stringed instrument’s sound. The effective length
of the string is also responsible for the pitch of the sound we hear.

The Decay slider determines how long it takes for the resonating string to decay to silence. Higher
values increase the decay time. The < Key slider next to Decay allows decay time to be modulated by
note pitch.

The Ratio slider sets the ratio of the decay time of the string’s oscillation during note onset and release.
At 0%, the time set by the Decay slider sets the decay time for both the onset and release of the note.
As you increase the Ratio, the release time decreases but the onset decay time stays the same.

The theoretical model of a resonating string is harmonic, meaning that the string’s partials are all exact
multiples of the fundamental frequency. Real-world strings, however, are all more or less inharmonic,
and this increases with the width of the string. The Inharm slider models this behavior, causing upper
partials to become increasingly out of tune as its value increases.

The Damping slider adjusts the amount of high frequency content in the string’s vibration. Higher
values result in more upper partials (less damping). This parameter can be modulated by note pitch
via the < Key slider to its right.

The Vibrato Section

Tension’s Vibrato Section.

The Vibrato section uses an LFO to modulate the string’s pitch. As with all of Tension’s parameters, the
controls in this section can be used to enhance the realism of a stringed instrument model — or to
create something never heard before.

The Vibrato section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name.

The Delay slider sets how long it will take for the vibrato to start after the note begins, while Attack sets
how long it takes for the vibrato to reach full intensity (as set by the Amount knob).

The two most important parameters in this section are the Rate and Amount sliders. Rate adjusts the
frequency of the pitch variation, while Amount adjusts the intensity (amplitude) of the effect.

The < Mod slider adjusts how much the modulation wheel will affect the vibrato intensity. This control is
relative to the value set by the Amount knob.

The Error slider introduces unpredictability into the vibrato, by introducing random deviation to the
Rate, Amount, Delay and Attack parameters.

28.12.2.5 The Termination Section

Tension’s Termination Section.

The Termination section models the interaction between the fret, finger and string. On a physical
instrument, this interaction is used to change the effective length of the string, which in turn sets the
pitch of the note played.

The Termination section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name.

The Finger Mass parameter can additionally be modulated by velocity or note pitch, via the Vel and
Key sliders.

The physical parameters of the finger are adjusted with the Finger Mass and Finger Stiff knobs, which
set the force the finger applies to the string and the finger’s stiffness, respectively. The stiffness of the
fret is modeled with the Fret Stiff parameter.

28.12.2.6 The Pickup Section

Tension’s Pickup Section.

The Pickup Section models the effect of an electromagnetic pickup, similar to the type found in an
electric guitar or electric piano. It can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. The only
control here is the Position slider, which functions similarly to this parameter in the Exciter and Damper
sections. At 0%, the pickup is located at the string’s termination point, while at 50% it is under the
midpoint of the string. Lower values generally result in a brighter, thinner sound, while higher values
have more fullness and depth.

The Body Section

Tension’s Body Section.

The role of the body or soundboard of a string instrument is to radiate the vibration energy from the
strings. The body also filters these vibrations, based on its size and shape. In some instruments, such as
guitars, the body also includes an air cavity which boosts low frequencies.

The Body section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name.

The Body Type chooser allows you to select from different body types modeled after physical
instruments.

The Body Size chooser sets the relative size of the resonant body, from extra small (XS) to extra large
(XL). In general, as you increase the body size, the frequency of the resonance will become lower.

The decay time of the body’s resonance can be adjusted with the Decay knob. Higher values mean a
longer decay.

The Str/Body knob adjusts the ratio between the String section’s direct output and the signal filtered
by the Body section. When turned all the way to the right, there is no direct output from the String
section. When turned all the way to the left, the Body section is effectively bypassed.

You can further modify the body’s frequency response with the Low Cut and High Cut knobs.

Tension’s Volume Knob.

The Volume knob to the right of the Body section sets the overall output of the instrument. This knob is
also accessible from the Filter/Global tab.

28.12.3 Filter/Global Tab

Tension’s Filter/Global Tab.

Tension’s Filter/Global tab features a polyphonic filter with envelope, LFO, and MIDI modulation
options, keyboard and portamento options, and an integrated Unison audio effect.

Tension’s Filter Section.

Tension’s Filter section features a highly configurable multi-mode filter that sits between the String and
Body sections. In addition, the filter can be modulated by a dedicated envelope generator and low-
frequency oscillator (LFO).

Note that the entire Filter section can be toggled on or off via the switch in the Filter subsection, while
the Filter Envelope and Filter LFO sections each have their own individual toggles.

The filter’s chooser allows you to select the filter type. You can choose between 2nd and 4th order
low-pass, band-pass, notch, high-pass and formant filters.

The resonance frequency of the filter is adjusted with the Freq slider, while the amount of resonance is
adjusted with the Res control. When a formant filter is selected, the Res control cycles between vowel
sounds. The Freq and Res controls can each be modulated by LFO, envelope or note pitch via the
sliders below. Note that the LFO and Env sliders have no effect unless the Envelope and LFO
subsections are enabled.

The Filter Envelope subsection can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. It is a standard
ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) with a few twists:

•

•

•

•

While the attack time is set with the Attack knob, this time can also be modulated by MIDI note
velocity via the Vel slider below the knob. As you increase the Vel value, the attack time will
become increasingly shorter at higher velocities.
The time it takes for the envelope to reach the sustain level after the attack phase is set by the
Decay knob.
The Sustain knob sets the level at which the envelope remains at the end of the decay phase
until the key is released. When this knob is turned all the way to the left, there is no sustain
phase. With it turned all the way to the right, there is no decay phase. The sustain level can be
additionally modulated by note velocity via the Vel slider below the knob. Higher values result
in an increased sustain level as the velocity increases.
The release time is set with the Release knob. This is the time it takes for the envelope to reach
zero after the key is released.

The Filter LFO subsection provides an additional modulation source for the filter. This section can be
toggled on or off via the switch next to its name.

The LFO waveform chooser sets the type of waveform used by the LFO. You can choose between sine,
triangle, rectangular and two types of random waveforms. The first random waveform steps between
random values while the second uses smoother ramps.

The LFO’s speed is set with the Rate knob. The switches below this knob toggle the Rate between
frequency in Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions.

Lastly, the Attack knob controls how long it takes for the oscillator to reach its full amplitude while the
Delay knob controls how long it will take for the LFO to start after the note begins.

Tension’s MPE Section.

The MPE section includes mapping options for MPE pressure and slide data, as well as the option to
set Tension’s global and per-note pitch bend ranges. All three MPE sources include Activity LEDs,
which light up whenever Tension receives MPE signals.

For both the Pressure and Slide sources, you can choose two destinations where MPE data is routed,
and adjust the level of modulation using the Amount sliders.

Pitch Bend controls allow you to adjust the modulation range for global pitch bend, as well as the
MPE per-note pitch bend (Note PB) in semitones.

Tension’s Keyboard Section.

The Keyboard section contains all of Tension’s polyphony, tuning, MIDI parameters.

The Octave, Semi and Detune controls function as coarse and fine tuners. Octave transposes the entire
instrument by octaves, while Semi transposes up or down in semitone increments. The Detune slider
adjusts in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of 50 cents up or down).

The Voices chooser sets the available polyphony.

Stretch simulates a technique known as stretch tuning, which is a common tuning modification made to
electric and acoustic pianos. At 0%, Tension will play in equal temperament, which means that two
notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s.
But because the actual resonance behavior of a vibrating tine or string differs from the theoretical

model, equal temperament tends to sound “wrong“ on pianos. Increasing the Stretch amount raises
the pitch of upper notes while lowering the pitch of lower ones. The result is a more brilliant sound.
Negative values simulate “negative“ stretch tuning; upper notes become flatter while lower notes
become sharper.

The Error slider increases the amount of random tuning error applied to each note. Try very high
values if you would like to relive your experiences from junior high school orchestra.

Lastly, Priority determines which notes will be cut off when the maximum polyphony is exceeded.
When Priority is set to High, new notes that are higher than currently sustained notes will have priority,
and notes will be cut off starting from the lowest pitch. Low Priority is the opposite. The Last setting
gives priority to the most recently played notes, cutting off the oldest notes as necessary.

Tension’s Portamento Section.

The Portamento section is used to make the pitch slide between notes rather than changing
immediately. The effect can be toggled on and off via the switch next to its name.

The Time slider sets the overall speed of the slide.

With Legato enabled, the sliding will only occur if the second note is played before the first note is
released.

Prop. (Proportional) causes the slide time to be proportional to the interval between the notes. Large
intervals will slide slower than small intervals. Disabling this switch causes the slide time to be constant
regardless of interval.

Tension’s Unison Section.

The Unison section allows you to stack multiple voices for each note played. Use the Unison toggle to
switch the section on or off.

The Voices switch selects between two or four stacked voices, while Detune adjusts the amount of
tuning variation applied to each stacked voice. Low values can create a subtle chorusing effect, while
high values provide another good way to approximate a youth orchestra.

Increasing the Delay amount adds lag before each stacked voice is activated.

Tension’s Volume Knob.

The Volume knob in the corner sets the overall output of the instrument. This knob is also accessible
from the String tab.

28.12.4 Sound Design Tips

At first glance, Tension’s modular architecture may not seem so different from what you’re used to in
other synthesizers; it consists of functional building blocks that feed information through a signal path
and modify it as it goes. But it’s important to remember that Tension’s components are not isolated from
one another; what you do to one parameter can have a dramatic effect on a parameter somewhere
else. Because of this, it’s very easy to find parameter combinations that produce no sound at all. It’s
also very easy to create extremely loud sounds, so be careful when setting levels!

When using Tension, it may help to think about the various sections as if they really are attached to a
single, physical object. For example, a bow moving at a slow speed could perhaps excite an
undamped string. But if that string is constricted by an enormous damper, the bow will need to
increase its velocity to have any effect.

To get a sense of what’s possible, it may help to study how the presets were made. You’ll soon realize
that Tension can do far more than just strings.

28.13 Wavetable

The Wavetable Instrument.

Wavetable is a synthesizer that combines two wavetable-based oscillators, two analog-modelled
filters, and a powerful but intuitive modulation system. It’s designed to be usable by musicians and
sound designers with any amount of synthesis experience; it’s simple enough to yield great results with
a minimum of effort but offers a nearly limitless range of possibilities as you go deeper.

Wavetable’s interface is divided into three main sections: the oscillators (which each have their own
tab), the two filters, and the modulation section (which is divided between three tabs). To see more
parameters in a single view, click the
the main Device View and the expanded view depending on the dimensions of your screen layout.

 button in Wavetable’s title bar. Parameters will move between

28.13.1 Wavetable Synthesis

Wavetable’s oscillators produce sound using a technique called wavetable synthesis. A wavetable is
simply an arbitrary collection of short, looping samples that are arranged together. Playing a note
with the oscillator fixed to just one of these samples will produce a steady tone with a consistent
timbre. But the real power of wavetable synthesis comes by moving between the various samples in
the table as the note plays, which results in a shifting timbre. Wavetable synthesis is extremely well-
suited for producing dynamic sounds that change over time.

28.13.2 Oscillators

Wavetable’s oscillators have been optimized for maximum sound quality. As long as no modulation is
applied, the raw output of the oscillators is perfectly band-limited and will not produce aliasing
artifacts at any pitch.

Wavetable’s Oscillators.

Each oscillator can be turned on or off independently via a switch in the oscillator’s tab. Clicking a tab
will select that oscillator, revealing its parameters for editing.

The overall output level of each oscillator is adjusted with its Gain slider, while its position in the stereo
field can be adjusted with the Pan control. The coarse and fine tuning of each oscillator can be set
with the Semi and Detune controls. Note that this tuning is in relation to the global Transposition slider.

Select a wavetable using the choosers or the arrow buttons. The first chooser selects a category of
wavetable, while the second chooser selects a specific wavetable from within that category. The
arrow buttons will automatically switch to the next category when you reach the end of the current
one, so you can continuously move through the wavetables using the arrows alone.

You can extend the sonic capabilities of Wavetable’s oscillator section by loading any WAV or AIFF
file as a wavetable. To do this, drag and drop a sample from the browser directly onto the wavetable
visualization. The choosers and arrow buttons will now reference the folder containing the imported
sample, allowing you to quickly audition any other samples in that folder.

Wavetable will automatically process imported samples to reduce unwanted artefacts. Note that you
can bypass this processing by activating the Raw mode switch. Raw mode is especially useful when
loading files that have been prepared specifically for use as a wavetable. However, it can also be
“misused” to create unpredictable, noisy or glitchy sounds.

Wavetable’s Raw Mode Switch.

The oscillator’s wavetable is visualized in the center of the oscillator tab. Clicking and dragging within
the visualization will move to a different position within the wavetable. You can also change the
wavetable position via the Wave Position slider.

There are two types of wavetable visualizations available, and these can be switched via the
wavetable visualization switch. Both views represent the same information, but visualized in different
ways. The linear view arranges the waveforms from bottom to top, with time running from left to right.
The polar view displays the waveforms as loops from inside to outside, with time running clockwise.

Although there is a huge range of available wavetables, it’s also possible to transform the sound of
each wavetable itself through the use of oscillator effects. Select from three effects in the chooser and
then adjust the parameters for those effects via the sliders to the right. The oscillator effects include:

•

•

•

FM — Applies frequency modulation to the oscillator. The Amt slider adjusts the intensity of the
frequency modulation, while the Tune slider determines the frequency of the modulation
oscillator. With a tuning of 50% (and -50%), the modulation oscillator is one octave higher (or
lower) than the main oscillator. At 100% (and -100%), the modulation oscillator is two octaves
higher (or lower). In between these values, the modulation oscillator is at inharmonic ratios,
which is ideal for creating noisy overtones.
Classic — Provides two modulation types that are common from classic analog synthesizers.
PW adjusts the pulse width of the waveform. Note that in hardware synthesizers, it is normally
only possible to adjust the pulse width of square waves. In Wavetable, the pulse width can be
adjusted for all wavetables. Sync applies a “hidden” oscillator that resets the phase of the
audible oscillator, altering its timbre.
Modern — Provides two additional options for distorting the shape of the waveform. Warp is
similar to pulse width, while Fold applies wavefolding distortion.

Note that the values of the two effects parameters don’t change when the effect type changes. This
makes it possible to move between the effects to experiment with how the different processes affect
the timbre with the same values.

28.13.3 Sub Oscillator

Wavetable’s Sub Oscillator.

In addition to the two main oscillators, Wavetable includes a sub oscillator. This can be toggled on or
off using the Sub toggle, and its output level is adjusted with the Gain knob.

The Tone control alters the timbre of the sub oscillator. At 0%, the oscillator produces a pure sine wave.
Turning Tone up increases the harmonic content of the waveform.

The tuning of the sub is determined by the played note and the global Transpose value, but you can
shift the sub down by one or two octaves using the Octave switches.

28.13.4 Filters

Wavetable’s filters can be very useful for shaping the sonically rich timbres created by the oscillators
and their effects. And, since the oscillators also provide you with the classic waveforms of analog
synthesizers, you can very easily build a subtractive-style synthesizer with them.

Wavetable’s Filters.

Wavetable offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a
special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 12 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection
of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware
filters found on some classic analog synthesizers.

The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ
Eight. This is available for all of the filter types.

The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping
diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all
filter types.

The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on
the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and
high-pass filters.

The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of
both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.

The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters
used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass
and high-pass filters.

The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance.
Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts
frequencies near that point. Note that you can adjust the Frequency and Resonance parameters by
clicking and dragging either of the filter dots in the filter display.

When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is
an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the
filter.

The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-
pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.

Filter routing allows you to arrange the filters in various configurations for drastically different sculpting
techniques. You can choose from one of three different routings:

•

•

Serial — Routes all oscillators into Filter 1, and routes Filter 1 into Filter 2. Sub is routed to both
filters.
Parallel — Routes the two main oscillators into Filter 1 and Filter 2. Sub is routed to both filters.

•

Split — Routes Oscillator 1 to Filter 1, and Oscillator 2 to Filter 2. Sub is split in half and sent to
both filters. If either filter is off, the corresponding oscillator’s signal is still audible. Split can be
used to treat each filter separately, and is useful for cases where you want to create layered
synth sounds. If the main oscillators are disabled while both filters are engaged, Split can also
be used to add extra treatment to the Sub oscillator.

28.13.5 Matrix Tab

The Modulation Matrix enables assigning modulation from Envelopes and LFOs (also known as
“internal modulation sources”) to parameters within the instrument (or “modulation targets”).

Wavetable’s Matrix Tab.

The modulation sources run horizontally, while the modulation targets run vertically. Click and drag
within the grid to change the amount of modulation that the selected source applies to the selected
parameter.

Note that certain parameters are additive modulation targets, while others are multiplicative
modulation targets.

Additive modulation is applied to a parameter using the following formula:

1.
2.

The outputs of a parameter’s modulation sources are summed together.
The summed modulation value is added to the current parameter value.

Modulation values for additive modulation are centered around 0, with 0 being the “neutral” value.
Additive modulation values can be negative or positive. Modulation sources that output negative and
positive values are “bipolar” sources. Modulation sources that only output positive values are
“unipolar” sources.

Multiplicative modulation is applied to a parameter using the following formula:

1.
2.

The outputs of a parameter’s modulation sources are multiplied together.
The multiplied modulation value is multiplied with the current parameter value.

The neutral value for multiplicative modulation is 1, and the minimum value is 0. Parameters with
multiplicative modulation are noted throughout the Wavetable manual.

Click on a parameter in the instrument to make it appear temporarily in the matrix. If you apply
modulation to this parameter, it will remain in the matrix. If no modulation is applied, the parameter
will disappear from the matrix when you click another parameter. Note that the Matrix tab and MIDI
tab share the same rows.

Click on any of the modulation source headers located above the matrix to quickly jump to its
respective panel within the Mod Sources tab.

The Time slider will scale the times of all the modulators. Negative values will make envelopes and
LFOs faster, while positive values will make them slower. Modulating this value with an envelope or
LFO will not affect the assigned modulator, but that modulator will still scale to other destinations.

The Amount slider sets the overall amount of modulation for all sources in the modulation matrix. Note
that this is a multiplicative modulation destination.

28.13.6 Mod Sources Tab

The Mod Sources tab allows you to adjust Envelope and LFO settings, which are described in more
detail below.

Wavetable’s Mod Sources Tab.

Envelopes

Wavetable’s envelopes (Amp, Env 2 and Env 3) can be modified using Time and Slope parameters,
while Env 2 and Env 3 include additional Value controls. Note that you can adjust the Time, Slope
and Value parameters by clicking and dragging the envelope display.

Attack sets the time needed to travel from the initial value to the Peak value. The shape of this stage of
the envelope is determined by the Attack Slope value.

Decay sets the time needed to travel from the Peak value to the Sustain level. The shape of this stage of
the envelope is determined by the Decay Slope value.

Sustain sets the level reached at the end of the Decay stage. The envelope will remain at this level until
a Note Off occurs, unless the Loop mode is set to Trigger or Loop, in which case it will continue to the
Release stage as soon as it is reached. Note that this is a multiplicative modulation destination.

Release sets the time needed to travel to the Final value after a Note Off occurs. The shape of this
stage of the envelope is determined by the Release Slope value.

As mentioned above, Wavetable’s envelopes also provide parameters that adjust the slope of their
envelope segments. Positive slope values cause the envelope to move quickly at the beginning, then
slower. Negative slope values cause the envelope to remain flat for longer, then move faster at the
end. A slope of zero is linear; the envelope will move at the same rate throughout the segment.

The Initial slider sets the starting value of the envelope when it is triggered. Note that this is a
multiplicative modulation destination. This control is not available for the amp envelope.

The Peak slider sets the value which marks the end of the Attack stage and the beginning of the Decay
stage. This control is not available for the amp envelope.

The Final slider sets the value at the end of the Release stage. This control is not available for the amp
envelope.

The Loop Modes drop-down lets you choose from one of three modes:

•
•
•

None will hold the Sustain portion until a Note Off, and will not loop.
Trigger will play all segments once a Note On is received.
Loop will loop the entire envelope without holding the Sustain, until the voice ends.

28.13.6.1 LFOs

Wavetable includes two LFOs, which can be adjusted individually via the parameters described in this
section.

Wavetable’s LFOs.

You can choose from one of five LFO waveforms, and use the Shape slider to modify the selected
waveform’s shape:

•
•
•
•

Sine and Saw: Applies an increasing or decreasing slope.
Triangle: Morphs the symmetry from Ramp to Saw, with Triangle in the middle.
Square: Changes the pulse width.
Random: Changes the distribution of extreme values.

The Sync switch sets the LFO Rate in Hertz or synced to the song tempo, while the Rate slider sets the
LFO frequency in Hertz or beat divisions. Note that you can also adjust the LFO frequency by
dragging the waveform display.

Amount adjusts the amount of LFO modulation that is applied to incoming signals. Note that this is a
multiplicative modulation destination.

The Offset slider offsets the phase of the LFO so that it starts at a different value. Note that Offset
cannot be modulated.

You can use the LFO Attack slider to adjust the time the LFO takes to fade in, when it has been
triggered by a Note On.

When enabled, the LFO Retrigger switch will cause the LFO to reset to its starting point, or initial
phase, on each new MIDI note. This can create hybrid LFO shapes if the LFO is retriggered before
completing a cycle.

28.13.7 MIDI Tab

Assigning MIDI to parameters can turn Wavetable into a dynamic performance instrument. Within the
MIDI Modulation Matrix, MIDI modulation sources can be assigned to multiple parameters within the
instrument (or “modulation targets”).

Wavetable’s MIDI Tab.

When Velocity is assigned, Wavetable will use the incoming MIDI note’s velocity value to modulate
target parameters for the duration of that note.

When Note is assigned, Wavetable will use the incoming MIDI note’s pitch to modulate target
parameters for the duration of that note. The pitch modulation range is centered around C3. This
means when it is assigned to Filter Frequency with the modulation amount set to 100%, the filter will
precisely track the played note.

Pitch Bend, Aftertouch and Modulation Wheel: these are hardware controls found on many MIDI
controller devices. If you do not have such a device, you can still modulate the parameters with clip
envelopes.

When Random is assigned, Wavetable will modulate target parameters by a random value, which is
calculated each time a note is triggered.

Click on a parameter in the instrument to make it appear temporarily in the matrix. If you apply
modulation to this parameter, it will remain in the matrix. If no modulation is applied, the parameter
will disappear from the matrix when you click another parameter. Note that the Matrix tab and MIDI
tab share the same rows.

28.13.8 Global and Unison Controls

Wavetable’s global controls affect the overall behavior and performance of the instrument.

Wavetable’s Global Controls.

Transpose adjusts the relative pitch of the Wavetable instrument in semitones.

Volume adjusts the overall level of the instrument. Note that is a multiplicative modulation destination.

The Poly/Mono toggle switches the instrument between a single voice with legato envelopes (Mono)
and a polyphonic instrument (Poly).

The Poly Voices drop-down menu lets you set the maximum number of notes that can sound
simultaneously. Note that Poly Voices is only active when the Poly/Mono switch is set to Poly.

Glide adjusts the time overlapping notes take to slide their pitch to the next incoming pitch. Note that
Glide is only active when the Poly/Mono switch is set to Mono.

The Unison drop-down menu lets you choose from one of six unison modes (or none). Unison modes
use multiple oscillators with different phases, stereo locations, or wavetable positions to provide a
fuller sound.

•

•

•

•

•

•

Classic: The oscillators are detuned with equal spacing and panned to alternating stereo
channels.
Shimmer: The oscillator pitches are jittered at random intervals, giving a shimmering reverb-like
effect. A small amount of wavetable offset is also applied for extra fullness.
Noise: Pitches are jittered as in the Shimmer unison mode, but at a much faster rate, resulting in
noisy breathy textures. A small amount of wavetable offset is applied for extra fullness.
Phase Sync: The oscillators are detuned as in Classic unison mode, but the phases are synced
when a note is started giving a strong sweeping phaser-style effect.
Position spread: The wavetable positions for each oscillator are evenly spread out by an
amount. A small amount of detune is additionally applied for extra width.
Random note: The wavetable positions and detune amount for each oscillator are randomised
each time a note is started.

The Voices slider sets the number of simultaneously running oscillators per wavetable oscillator. More
voices will result in a thicker sound, whereas less voices will sound clearer.

The Amount slider adjusts the intensity of the unison effect, and has different behavior in each unison
mode. Note that this is a multiplicative modulation destination.

28.13.9 Hi-Quality Mode

Wavetable’s Hi-Quality Option.

You can toggle on Hi-Quality mode on or off from Wavetable’s context menu.

When Hi-Quality is off, Wavetable modulation is calculated every 32 samples. Low-power versions
of the Cytomic filters are also used to further reduce CPU.

Using Wavetable with Hi-Quality mode off can save up to 25% CPU compared to having it enabled,
which is ideal for working with large sets or maintaining low latencies.

As of Live 11.1, Hi-Quality mode will be off by default when loading a new instance of Wavetable or
any of its Core Library presets. However, any user presets or Live Sets created previously will still load
Wavetable in Hi-Quality mode to ensure sound consistency with earlier Live versions.

Note: Subtle sound differences may occur when Hi-Quality mode is enabled.

29. Max for Live

Max for Live, an add-on product co-developed with Cycling ’74, allows users to extend and
customize Live by creating instruments, audio and MIDI effects, as well as MIDI Tools. Max for Live
can also be used to extend the functionality of hardware controllers and even modify clips and
parameters within a Live Set.

In addition to providing a comprehensive toolkit for building devices, Max for Live also comes with a
collection of pre-made instruments, effects, MIDI Tools and tutorials. These can be used just like Live’s
built-in devices and can also give you ideas for your own device building projects.

29.1 Setting Up Max for Live

Max for Live comes pre-installed with Live Suite, as well as Standard when using the Max for Live
add-on, and does not require any additional setup.

However, if you prefer to use an external Max installation, you will first need to point to it in Live’s File
& Folder Settings:

The Path to the Max Installation.

Once Live has found the external Max application, Max for Live should be ready for use. At this point,
the Max content will begin to install into your Live Library.

29.2 Using Max for Live Devices

Max for Live comes with a collection of instruments, effects and MIDI Tools which are ready for use. A
selection of Max for Live devices from Live’s Core Library can be found in the Instruments, Audio
Effects and MIDI Effects labels within the browser. Additional Max for Live devices as well as Max for
Live MIDI Tools appear in the Max for Live label in the browser.

Many of these devices also come with their own presets, which are similar to Live’s device presets but
with one important difference: because a Max device can be stored outside of Live’s known locations,
it is important to make sure that any presets that refer to this device remain associated with it.

If you save a preset for a Max device, Live will try to maintain the necessary file references by
copying the Max device into your User Library and saving the preset based on this copy. If the
referenced Max file is then moved or renamed, however, these file associations may be broken. If this
happens, you can use Live’s File Manager to fix the problem.

To avoid these issues, we recommend always storing Max devices and their presets in your User
Library. Note that this is the default location that is suggested when pressing the Save Preset button in
the title bar of the Max device.

29.3 Editing Max for Live Devices

Max devices (or “patches“) are constructed of objects that send data to each other via virtual cables.
An empty Max Audio Effect, for example, already contains some of these elements: the plugin~ object
passes all incoming audio to the plugout~ object, which then passes the audio on to any additional
devices in the chain.

A Default Max Audio Effect.

To load an empty Max device, drag a Max Instrument, Max MIDI Effect or Max Audio Effect from the
browser into your Set.

What a Max device actually does depends on the objects that it contains, and the way in which
they’re connected together. The area where you work with Max objects is called the editor (or
“patcher“), and can be accessed by pressing the Edit button in the Max device’s title bar.

The Edit Button for a Max Device.

This launches the Max editor in a new window, with the current device loaded and ready for editing.

A Default Max Audio Effect in the Patcher.

After editing, you should save your Max device before you use it in Live. This is done via the Save or
Save As commands in Max’s File menu. Saving an edited device will automatically update all
instances of that device that are used in your current Live Set. If you choose Save As, you will be
asked whether or not the new version should update only the device that was originally opened for
editing or all instances of the device in the Set.

The default location when saving a Max device is the folder in the Library that corresponds to the type
of device being saved. We recommend always saving Max devices to this default location.

Unlike Live’s native devices, Max devices are not saved inside Live Sets, but rather as separate files.

29.4 Building Max for Live MIDI Tools

You can create your own Max for Live MIDI Tools in two ways:

1.

2.

By using the Max MIDI Transformation or Generator template included in the Transformation
and Generative Tools tabs/panels respectively.
By editing an existing Max for Live MIDI Tool.

Building a Max for Live MIDI Tool follows the same principles as building other Max for Live devices:
with a Max MIDI Transformation/Generator template or an existing Max for Live MIDI Tool selected,
click on the Edit button to launch the Max editor (“patcher”).

The Edit Button in a Max MIDI Transformation.

When you are done editing, use the Save or Save As commands in the patcher’s File menu to save the
Max for Live MIDI Tool.

By default, Max for Live MIDI Tools are saved to these folders on your computer:

•
•

Transformations: ~/Music/Ableton/User Library/MIDI Tools/Max Transformations
Generators: ~/Music/Ableton/User Library/MIDI Tools/Max Generators

Alternatively, any folder within Places in Live’s browser can be used to store the MIDI Tools’ AMXD
files. For example, you could create a new folder called “My Favorite MIDI Tools” and save the Max
for Live MIDI Tools you have built within this folder. Then when you add the folder to Places in Live,
these MIDI Tools will appear in the drop-down menus in the Transformation/Generative Tools tabs/
panels.

Note that if Max for Live MIDI Tools are not saved to the default location or within Live’s Places, they
will not be found by Live’s Indexer, and therefore will not appear in the Clip View’s Transformation/
Generative Tools tabs/panels.

For more information on the Max objects used for creating Max for Live MIDI Tools, as well as a
walkthrough of patching a Max for Live Transformation or Generator, please refer to the Max for Live
MIDI Tools guide, accessible via the Max documentation. In a Max window, select Reference from
the Help Menu, navigate to the Max for Live category and then Guides.

29.5 Max Dependencies

As mentioned earlier, there are some special file management considerations when creating presets
for Max devices. Additionally, Max devices themselves may depend on other files (such as samples,
pictures, or even other Max patches) in order to work properly. Max for Live helps to deal with
external dependencies by allowing you to freeze a Max device. A frozen device contains all of the
files that are needed to use it.

Note that freezing of Max devices is not the same as Live’s Freeze Track command.

To learn more about freezing, and about how Max deals with managing dependencies for its own
files, we recommend reading the built-in Max documentation.

29.6 Learning Max Programming

To help you learn more about building and editing Max devices, Cycling ’74 provides comprehensive
documentation and tutorials built into the Max environment. To access this documentation, select
“Reference“ from the Help menu in any Max window. There is also a Max for Live section within the
documentation contents.

You can also read the Max for Live Production Guidelines documentation on GitHub.

For hands-on learning, we suggest downloading the Building Max Devices Pack, which contains in-
depth lessons that cover all the steps you need to build your own Max tools.

Additionally, you can check out the Learn Max page from Cycling ’74 for a comprehensive collection
of learning resources.

30. Max for Live Devices

Live comes with a selection of custom-designed, built-in Max for Live devices. These devices include
instruments, effects, and MIDI Tools.

Because Max for Live devices are based on Max, you can edit and customize them in the Max editor
— unlike native Live devices. You can read more about this in the Max for Live chapter.

To learn the basics of using devices in Live, check out the Working with Instruments and Effects
chapter.

Note that different editions of Live have different feature sets, so some devices covered in this
reference may not be available in all editions.

30.2 Max for Live Audio Effects

30.2.1 Align Delay

The Align Delay Effect

Align Delay is a utility delay for incoming signals that can be set in samples, milliseconds, or meters/
feet.

Using the Delay Mode drop-down menu, you can choose between three delay modes: Time,
Samples, and Distance.

Time mode sets the delay in milliseconds and can be used to adjust time between lasers and AV work,
or as a subtle stereo maker.

Samples mode sets the delay in samples and can be used to compensate for latency introduced by
other devices.

Distance mode sets the delay in meters or feet, either option can be toggled by using the m/ft button
next to the left and right delay sliders. Distance mode can be used to adjust PA system alignment or
monitor to main PA alignment.

You will also see a Celsius/Fahrenheit Temperature option in Distance mode. Matching the
temperature setting to the current temperature in the room you are using Align Delay in allows for
more precise delay adjustment as the sound will travel differently in warm and cold environments.

With Stereo Link engaged, the left channel’s settings are applied to the right channel and the right
channel will appear greyed out. Changing the settings for the left channel will apply the changes to
both sides.

30.2.2 Envelope Follower

The Envelope Follower Effect.

Envelope Follower uses a well-known technique which involves capturing a signal, smoothing and
reshaping its amplitude course in order to obtain a more or less continuous curve, and finally mapping
the curve to one or more control parameters. The “auto-wah” effect is perhaps the most well-known
application of the envelope following technique.

Activate the Map switch and click on a parameter in Live to assign that parameter as a mapping
target. To assign an additional mapping target, click on the button at the top-right of the display, click
any of the unassigned Map switches and click on another parameter in Live. A total of eight
parameters can be assigned. To unassign a parameter, click on the button to the right of its Map
switch. For each modulated parameter, the Min and Max sliders let you scale the resulting output
range after the modulation is applied.

You can use the Gain knob to set the gain applied to the incoming signal.

The Rise parameter smooths the attack of the envelope, while the Fall control smooths the release of
the envelope.

The Delay control sets the delay time of the envelope. The switches to the right of the Delay control
toggle the delay mode between time-based and tempo-synced beat divisions.

30.2.3 LFO

The LFO Effect.

LFO is a parameter modulation LFO for Live-specific parameters and third party plug-in parameters.

Activate the Map switch and click on a parameter in Live to assign that parameter as a mapping
target. To assign an additional mapping target, click on the button at the top-right of the display, click
any of the unassigned Map switches and click on another parameter in Live. A total of eight
parameters can be assigned. To unassign a parameter, click on the button to the right of its Map
switch. For each modulated parameter, the Min and Max sliders let you scale the resulting output
range after the modulation is applied.

You can choose from one of seven different waveforms: sine, sawtooth up, sawtooth down, triangle,
rectangle, random and binary noise.

The Jitter slider adds randomness to the waveform, while the Smooth control smooths value changes.

The Rate control specifies the LFO speed. The switches to the right of the Rate control toggle between
frequency in Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions.

Depth sets the overall intensity of the LFO. Offset changes the starting point, or initial phase of an LFO,
so that it begins at a different point in its cycle.

The phase of the oscillator can be shifted using the Phase control.

To hold the current output value, activate the Hold switch.

You can click the R (Retrigger) button to re-trigger the phase of the LFO.

30.2.4 Shaper

The Shaper Effect.

Shaper is a multi-breakpoint envelope which generates modulation data for musical expression.

Activate the Map switch and click on a parameter in Live to assign that parameter as a mapping
target. To assign an additional mapping target, click on the button at the top-right of the display, click
any of the unassigned Map switches and click on another parameter in Live. A total of eight
parameters can be assigned. To unassign a parameter, click on the button to the right of its Map
switch. For each modulated parameter, the Min and Max sliders let you scale the resulting output
range after the modulation is applied.

You can create a breakpoint by clicking anywhere in the display. You can also delete a breakpoint by
Shift -clicking on it. Hold down the Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) key while dragging to create
curved segments.

To clear the display, press the Clear button in the bottom left corner. To the right of the Clear button,
you can choose from one of six breakpoint presets.

You can adjust the size of the grid via the Grid slider. When Snap is enabled, all breakpoints that you
create or reposition will snap to grid lines.

The smaller display on the top right provides an oscilloscope-style view of the output signal. The Jitter
slider adds randomness to the waveform, while the Smooth control smooths value changes.

The Rate control specifies the LFO speed. The switches to the right of the Rate control toggle between
frequency in Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions.

Depth sets the overall intensity of the LFO. The phase of the oscillator can be shifted using the Phase
control.

You can click the R (Retrigger) button to re-trigger the phase of the LFO. Note that re-trigger is not
available if the Rate control is set to Sync mode.

Offset changes the starting point, or initial phase of an LFO, so that it begins at a different point in its
cycle.

30.3 Max for Live MIDI Effects

30.3.1 Envelope MIDI

The Envelope MIDI Effect.

Envelope MIDI is an ADSR device that you can control any Live parameter with.

Activate the Map switch and click on a parameter in Live to assign that parameter as a mapping
target. To assign an additional mapping target, click on the button at the top-right of the display, click
any of the unassigned Map switches and click on another parameter in Live. A total of eight
parameters can be assigned. To unassign a parameter, click on the button to the right of its Map
switch. For each modulated parameter, the Min and Max sliders let you scale the resulting output
range after the modulation is applied.

The Loop Mode drop-down lets you choose from one of four loop modes:

•
•

•

Free: The trigger rate is unaffected.
Sync: The trigger rate is defined by the song tempo. When Sync mode is active, you can set the
trigger rate via the Sync Rate drop-down.
Loop: The trigger rate is defined by the envelope time.

•

Echo: This creates repetitions of the original envelope. When Echo is active, you can adjust the
Envelope Echo Time and amount of Envelope Echo Feedback.

The Time slider sets the global envelope time.

When the Velocity switch is enabled, the envelope is modulated by note velocity. The Amount control
determines the intensity of the modulation.

The Attack control sets the attack time of the envelope. The Attack Slope slider adjusts the shape of the
Attack envelope segment.

The Decay control sets the decay time of the envelope. The Decay Slope slider adjusts the shape of the
Decay envelope segment.

The Sustain control sets the level reached at the end of the Decay stage. The Sustain Mode switch
toggles the Sustain function on or off.

The Release control sets the release time of the envelope. The Release Slope slider adjusts the shape of
the Release envelope segment.

You can adjust the Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release parameters by clicking and dragging the
envelope display.

30.3.2 Expression Control

The Expression Control Effect.

Expression Control is a MIDI effect that lets you control, transform, and map MIDI and MPE
expression data. This version of Expression Control is a new take on the Max for Live device of the
same name, with expanded functionality and a redesigned user interface centered around a visual
display of the device’s modulation curves.

The previous version of this device is still available and has been renamed Expression Control Legacy.
Live Sets made in Live 11 that contain Expression Control will load the Expression Control Legacy
device automatically.

Expression Control has five Mod Source Tabs that can be used to set a MIDI or MPE expression
parameter as a modulation source. A MIDI Input Source drop-down menu in each tab lets you
choose between ten expression parameters: Velocity, Modwheel, Pitchbend, Pressure, Keytrack,
Expression, Random, Increment, Slide, and Sustain.

Clicking on the Map to Target button links the selected modulation source to whichever parameter in
Live that’s clicked on next.

The controls in the Output Range section depend on the Modulation toggle at the top right of the
device. This toggle sets how Expression Control’s modulation values are generated, and has two
modes: Modulate or Remote Control.

When Modulate is selected, base values of a mapped parameter can be adjusted using your cursor.
In this mode, the value set or automated by Expression Control will be merged with the value being set
as you tweak the parameter in question. When Remote Control is selected, modulated parameter
values are set by Expression Control and interaction with base parameter values is no longer possible.

The Modulation toggle also affects Expression Control’s polarity modes. When Modulate is selected,
a Modulation Polarity toggle in the Output Range section lets you choose between bipolar and
unipolar modes. In Bipolar mode, modulation is centered around the base parameter value being
modulated. In Unipolar mode, modulation is added to the base parameter value being modulated.
The Output Range Max slider sets the output modulation value generated when the input signal is at
its maximum amplitude. When Remote Control is selected, the Output Range section lets you set
minimum and maximum output modulation values using the Output Range Min and Output Range
Max sliders.

The Curve Type buttons below the Curve Display can be used to select a linear or S-shaped curve.
The type of curve selected determines which controls are available in the Curve section.

When a linear curve (with two breakpoints) is selected, the Curve A dial adjusts the modulation
curve’s entire shape. When an S-shaped curve (with three breakpoints) is selected, the Curve A dial
adjusts the curve’s upper segment shape and the Curve B dial adjusts its lower segment shape. When
the Curve Link button is enabled, the curve’s upper and lower segments can be inversely adjusted
using only the Curve A dial.

The Curve Display provides a visualization of the modulation curve being generated by the device.
Minimum and maximum values for the curve can be set via the Min/Max sliders. When an S-shaped
curve is selected, the middle breakpoint’s horizontal and vertical positions can be set via the X-Y
sliders. Breakpoints and curve shape can also be adjusted by clicking and dragging the visualized
curve directly in the display.

When Increment is selected as a modulation source in any MIDI Input Source drop-down menu, the
Increment Steps slider is activated. This value defines how many note triggers are necessary to cycle
through the device’s entire modulation range, and can be set to a value from 1 to 32 steps. Stopping

transport will reset the count, so that the first note played when transport restarts will output the
minimum modulation value that has been set.

When Random is selected as a modulation source in any MIDI Input Source drop-down menu, the
Random Amount slider is activated. This slider sets how much random deviation is applied to the target
modulation value with each note trigger.

The Smoothing Type toggle lets you choose between linear or logarithmic smoothing between
modulation values.

The Smoothing Rise and Fall sliders set the amount of time it takes for increasing and decreasing
modulation values to reach the most recent value, from 0 to 1000 milliseconds.

30.3.3 Expression Control Legacy

The Expression Control Legacy Effect.

Expression Control Legacy is a parameter modulation device that allows for a wide variety of internal
MIDI mappings. The MIDI controller’s Velocity, Modulation Wheel, Pitch Bend, Aftertouch and
Keytrack can each be mapped to one destination.

Activate a Map switch and click on a parameter in Live to assign that parameter as a mapping target.

You can set independent modulation intensities for each mapping via the Min and Max sliders.

The Log and Lin switches toggle between logarithmic and linear shapes.

The Rise slider smooths the attack of the envelope, while the Fall slider smooths the release of the
envelope.

The Output displays show the output level for each mapping.

30.3.4 MIDI Monitor

The MIDI Monitor Effect.

MIDI Monitor is a utility MIDI device that displays incoming MIDI and MPE data.

MIDI data can be viewed in either the Note display or Flow diagram.

In the Note display, incoming MIDI notes are shown along with their root note and related chords (if
played) on a keyboard layout. Note velocity is also shown.

The Flow diagram populates a list of incoming MIDI notes and data (such as pitch bend and
aftertouch messages) in a continuous stream as notes are played. The Freeze toggle can be used to
freeze or unfreeze the display, while the Clear button clears the entire display.

The Flow Diagram.

MPE data can be viewed in the MPE display. Incoming note, velocity, slide, pressure and per-note
pitch data are shown in a continuous stream as notes are played.

The MPE Display.

30.3.5 MPE Control

The MPE Control Effect.

MPE Control is a Max for Live MIDI effect that allows shaping and transforming incoming MPE (MIDI
Polyphonic Expression) signals, and offers distinctive adjustment options for each MPE data source. It
is typically used in conjunction with another device to fine-tune the effect MPE data has on mapped

parameters. MPE Control also allows converting MPE signals to global MIDI, making it possible to
use an MPE controller with non-MPE enabled instruments.

Before we get into the details of how you can use the MPE Control effect to shape the incoming MPE
data, let’s have a look at the difference between MPE and standard MIDI messages. MPE enables
MIDI Control Change (or MIDI CC) messages to be sent on a per-note basis, thus allowing you to
articulate each note individually. Without MPE, those messages are sent globally, meaning that all
notes are affected by the MIDI CC being used. For more detailed information on MPE check out the
Editing MPE chapter.

While MPE already allows a lot more musical expression than standard MIDI data, MPE Control
gives you the ability to shape the MPE signals to a greater extent using curves, making it possible to
play even more expressively. Let’s say you are using the Expression Control device and mapped its
Slide MIDI input to the Filter Freq knob in Operator. Any incoming MPE slide data will affect the filter
frequency. You can then use MPE Control to fine-tune the signal further, so that only very high slide
values will reach a high frequency cutoff.

In MPE Control, the incoming MPE signals can be transformed via two types of curves that can be
smoothed for consistent rise and fall times. There are three signal sources available: Press (pressure),
Slide, as well as NotePB (per-note pitch bend), and each can be adjusted individually.

The curve of the selected MPE source is shown in the foreground of the display, making that curve and
its respective controls available for editing. By default, all MPE sources are switched on, but they can
be deactivated separately by clicking on the toggles next to their names.

For each MPE source, you can choose between two types of curve settings in the bottom left corner of
the display: linear or S-shaped. The linear curve has two breakpoints, while the S-shaped curve has
three breakpoints.

Choosing the linear setting lets you adjust the curve in two ways. You can use either the Curve control
knob or click and drag the curve directly in the display. In addition to adjusting the curve, you can
also modify the minimum and maximum values using the Min and Max sliders, or by dragging the
breakpoints at the ends of the curve.

The linear setting provides one curve, creating a smooth ramp for the chosen modulation source,
either “compressing” the data, making it easier to stay in the lower range of values, or “expanding” it,
making it easier to reach higher values with less input.

When choosing the S-shaped curve, a third breakpoint is added to the middle of the curve’s line,
separating the curve into two distinct segments. This breakpoint is movable, allowing complete control
over the crossover point between the two segments, giving you the possibility to create much more
radical curves. The two segments are linked together by default. Toggling the Curve Link button
separates the segments from each other, so that they can be individually compressed or expanded
using the two independent Curve dials.

Note that the position of the breakpoint separating the two segments can be adjusted either by
directly clicking and dragging the breakpoint, or by using the X-Y controls at the bottom of the display.
The X-Y controls are only active when using the S-shaped curve.

Clicking on the triangular button in the bottom right of the visualization will unfold the advanced
settings panel.

MPE Control’s Expanded View.

All of the three modulation sources include the Smooth toggle which enables smoothing for the
currently selected source. Specific Rise and Fall values for each of the curves can be set
independently via the respective controls, and additional controls are available depending on the
source you are editing.

30.3.5.1 Press

The Press source can be used to alter MPE pressure data, which, similarly to polyphonic aftertouch, is
sent on a per-note basis when pressure is applied to a controller’s key or pad after it was initially
struck.

Press Advanced Settings.

Press includes a Default toggle, which gives you the option to set a default MPE value to use with
MIDI notes that do not contain MPE data. You can also choose to send the MPE pressure data to the
Slide instead of the Press source by using the Swap to Slide toggle. This is useful when, for example,
you want to adjust the modulation via the vertical axis, but are using a controller which only supports
polyphonic aftertouch.

The Press to AT setting converts the MPE pressure data to monophonic aftertouch, so that non-MPE
instruments can be modulated via an MPE controller.

30.3.5.2 Slide

The Slide source modifies MPE slide data (transmitted as MIDI CC 74), which corresponds to the
vertical position of the finger on the controller key or pad.

Slide Advanced Settings.

Slide also includes a Default toggle for use with non-MPE data, as well as a Centered switch which is
useful when playing pad-based MPE controllers. When Centered is switched on, MPE slide data is
transformed so that hitting the center of the pad generates a modulation value of zero, and the
modulation value increases progressively as the finger slides away from the center alongside the
vertical axis.

By default, Slide is set to Abs mode, which means that MPE slide values are interpreted as absolute.
Switching the mode to Rel (relative) will set the slide values to start in the middle of the range,
regardless of where the finger is on the key or pad. They can then only be modified by further
sweeping the finger up and down while holding a note. In the Ons (onset) mode, MPE slide values
will only be updated with a Note On. Note that onset mode will automatically deactivate smoothing.

The Slide to Mod option transforms MPE slide messages to Mod Wheel (CC1) messages, allowing to
modulate non-MPE enabled instruments with an MPE controller.

30.3.5.3 NotePB

The NotePB source modifies the MPE per-note pitch bend data, which is produced by horizontal
movement on the controller’s keys or pads. Pitch bend by definition only affects the pitch or pitches
being produced.

NotePB Advanced Settings.

In the NotePB advanced settings, you can adjust the Pitch Range, which is useful in cases where the
hardware controller and the instrument’s pitch bend range do not match. For example, a setting of 2x
allows mapping an MPE controller with a +/- 48 semitone pitch bend range to an instrument whose
pitch bend range is +/- 24 semitones. If the Note Pitch Bend MIDI CC is mapped to anything other
than pitch, using higher values helps to cover a larger modulation range with a smaller movement.

When the NotePB to PB switch is switched on, MPE per-note pitch bend messages are translated to
standard MIDI messages, which makes it possible for MPE-enabled MIDI controllers to still send MIDI
information to instruments that do not receive MPE messages.

30.3.6 Note Echo

The Note Echo Effect.

Note Echo is an echo delay effect that creates additional MIDI notes at specific time intervals with
decreasing velocity.

Activate the Sync switch, which allows using the Delay Time beat division chooser. The numbered
switches represent time delay in 16th notes. For example, selecting ”4” delays the signal by four 16th
notes, which equals one beat (a quarter note) of delay.

Changing the Delay Time field percentage value shortens and extends delay times by fractional
amounts, thus producing the ”swing” type of timing effect found in drum machines.

If the Sync switch is off, the delay time reverts to milliseconds. To edit the delay time, click and drag the
Delay Time slider up or down, or click in the field and type in a value.

The Input switches lets you toggle between Thru/Mute playback modes. When Thru is active, both the
MIDI note and echo are played back. When Mute is active, the MIDI note is muted and only the echo
is audible.

Pitch sets the transposition amount applied to the note with each repeat of the echo.

Delay sets the amount of velocity applied to the echo. The Fback parameter defines how much of the
channel’s output signal feeds back into the delay line’s input.

Switching on the MPE toggle allows incoming MPE data to be echoed alongside MIDI notes and
velocity data. Otherwise, MPE data is filtered out.

With the MPE toggle switched on, the Press, Slide, and Note PB sliders become active and define the
feedback amount for the pressure, slide and per-note pitch bend data respectively. Setting the
feedback amount to lower than 100% will cause the echoed MPE data to progressively decay with
each repetition.

30.3.7 Shaper MIDI

The Shaper MIDI Effect.

Like Shaper, Shaper MIDI uses multi-breakpoint envelopes to generate mappable modulation data.
Shaper MIDI can also be triggered dynamically using MIDI notes/velocity.

Activate the Map switch and click on a parameter in Live to assign that parameter as a mapping
target.

To assign an additional mapping target, click on the Multimap button at the top-right of the display.
You can select any of the unassigned Map switches and click on another parameter in Live to assign it
as a mapping target. A total of eight parameters can be assigned. To unassign a parameter, click on
the button to the right of its Map switch.

For each modulated parameter, the Min and Max sliders let you scale the resulting output range after
the modulation is applied.

You can create a breakpoint by clicking anywhere in the display. You can delete a breakpoint by
Shift -clicking on it. Hold down the Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) key while dragging to create
curved segments.

To clear the display, press the Clear button in the bottom left corner. To the right of the Clear button,
you can choose from one of six breakpoint presets and one random breakpoint generator.

You can adjust the size of the grid via the Grid slider. When Snap is enabled, all breakpoints that you
create or reposition will snap to grid lines.

The smaller display on the top right provides an oscilloscope-style view of the output signal. The Jitter
slider adds randomness to the waveform, while the Smooth control smooths value changes.

The Rate control specifies the envelope modulation speed. The switches to the right of the Rate control
toggle between frequency in Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions.

Depth sets the overall intensity of the envelope modulation. The velocity sensitivity of the modulation
depth can be adjusted using the Velocity control.

The Offset control takes over the value of the mapped parameter so that the envelope can modulate
that value.

Echo adjusts the amount of the envelope echo, while the Time control sets the echo time in
milliseconds.

Activating the Loop switch will loop the modulation envelope as long as a MIDI note is held.

30.4 Max for Live MIDI Tools

In addition to Live’s MIDI Tools, you can also access Max for Live MIDI Tools to transform and
generate notes in clips. Max for Live MIDI Tools are AMXD files that can be used in the Transform or
Generative Tools tab/panel in the Clip View. You can edit or create Max for Live MIDI Tools in a Max
patcher like any other Max device.

There are two built-in Max for Live MIDI Tools included with Live Standard and Suite: Velocity Shaper
and Euclidean. If you use the Suite edition or the Standard edition with the Max for Live add-on, you
can also edit and build your own Max for Live MIDI Tools or use Max for Live MIDI Tools from third-
party creators.

In order for third-party Max for Live MIDI Tools to show up in the Transform and Generative tabs/
panels in the Clip View, save them in these folders on your computer:

•
•

Transformations: ~/Music/Ableton/User Library/MIDI Tools/Max Transformations
Generators: ~/Music/Ableton/User Library/MIDI Tools/Max Generators

Alternatively, you can save the third-party MIDI Tools’ AMXD files in any folder within Places in Live’s
browser.

31. MIDI and Key Remote Control

To liberate the musician from the mouse, most of Live’s controls can be remote-controlled with an
external MIDI controller and the computer keyboard. This chapter describes the details of mapping to
the following specific types of controls in Live’s user interface:

1.

2.

3.

4.
5.

Session View slots — Note that MIDI and computer key assignments are bound to the slots, not
to the clips they contain.
Switches and buttons — Among them the Track and Device Activator switches, the Control Bar’s
tap tempo, metronome and transport controls.
Radio buttons — A radio button selects from among a number of options. One instance of a
radio button is the crossfader assignment section in each track, which offers three options: The
track is assigned to the crossfader’s A position, the track is unaffected by the crossfader, or the
track is affected by the crossfader’s B position.
Continuous controls — Like the mixer’s volume, pan and sends.
The crossfader — The behavior of which is described in detail in the respective section of the
Mixing chapter.

31.1 MIDI Remote Control

Live can be controlled remotely by external MIDI control surfaces, such as MIDI keyboards or
controller boxes. Live also offers dedicated control via Ableton Push 1, Push 2, and Push 3.

Before we explain how remote control assignments are made and implemented, let’s first make the
distinction between MIDI remote control and a separate use of MIDI in Live: as the input for our MIDI
tracks. Let’s suppose that you are using a MIDI keyboard to play an instrument in one of Live’s MIDI
tracks. If you assign C-1 on your MIDI keyboard to a Session View Clip Launch button, that key will
cease playing C-1 of your MIDI track’s instrument, as it now ”belongs” solely to the Clip Launch
button.

MIDI keys that become part of remote control assignments can no longer be used as input for MIDI
tracks. This is a common cause of confusion that can be easily resolved by observing the Control Bar’s
MIDI indicators.

Before making any MIDI assignments, you will need to set up Live to recognize your control surfaces.
This is done in the Link, Tempo & MIDI tab of Live’s Settings, which can be opened with the Ctrl
,
(Win) / Cmd

, (Mac) keyboard shortcut.

31.1.1 Natively Supported Control Surfaces

Control Surfaces are defined via the menus in the Link, Tempo & MIDI tab. Up to six supported control
surfaces can be used simultaneously in Live.

Setting Up Control Surfaces.

Open the first chooser in the Control Surface column to see whether your control surface is supported
natively by Live; if it is listed here, you can select it by name, and then define its MIDI input and output
ports using the two columns to the right. If your controller is not listed here, don’t fret — it can still be
enabled manually in the next section, Manual Control Surface Setup.

Depending on the controller, Live may need to perform a ”preset dump” to complete the setup. If this
is the case, the Dump button to the right of your control surface’s choosers in the Live Settings will
become enabled. Before pressing it, verify that your control surface is ready to receive preset dumps.
The method for enabling this varies for each manufacturer and product, so consult your hardware’s
documentation if you are unsure. Finally, press the Dump button; Live will then set up your hardware
automatically.

31.1.1.1 Instant Mappings

In most cases, Live uses a standard method for mapping its functions and parameters to physical
controls. This varies, of course, depending upon the configuration of knobs, sliders and buttons on the
control surface. These feature-dependent configurations are known as instant mappings.

Within Live’s built-in lessons, you will find a Control Surface Reference that lists all currently supported
hardware, complete with the details of their instant mappings. Lessons can be accessed at any time by
selecting the Help View option from the View menu.

You can always manually override any instant mappings with your own assignments. In this case, you
will also want to enable the Remote switches for the MIDI ports that your control surface is using. This
is done in the MIDI Ports section of the Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings tab, and is described in the next
section.

Instant mappings are advantageous because the control surface’s controllers will automatically
reassign themselves in order to control the currently selected device in Live.

Control Surfaces Can Follow Device Selection.

In addition to following device selection, natively supported control surfaces can be ”locked” to
specific devices, guaranteeing hands-on access no matter where the current focus is in your Live Set.
To enable or disable locking, right-click on a device’s title bar, and then select your preferred
controller from the ”Lock to…” context menu. You’ll recognize the same list of control surfaces that you
defined in the Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings. By default, the instrument in a MIDI track will
automatically be locked to the control surface when the track is armed for recording.

Getting Hands-On: Control Surfaces Can Be Locked to Devices.

A hand icon in the title bar of locked devices serves as a handy reminder of their status.

Note: Some control surfaces do not support locking to devices. This capability is indicated for
individual controllers in the Control Surface Reference lesson. Select the Help View option from the
Help menu to access Live’s built-in lessons.

31.1.2 Manual Control Surface Setup

If your MIDI control surface is not listed in the Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings’ Control Surface chooser, it
can still be enabled for manual mapping in the MIDI Ports section of this tab.

Defining Control Surfaces Manually.

The MIDI Ports table lists all available MIDI input and output ports. To use an input port for remote
control of Live, make sure the corresponding switch in its Remote column is set to ”On.” You can use
any number of MIDI ports for remote mapping; Live will merge their incoming MIDI signals.

When working with a control surface that provides physical or visual feedback, you will also need to
enable the Remote switch for its output port. Live needs to be able to communicate with such control
surfaces when a value has changed so that they can update the positions of their motorized faders or
the status of their LEDs to match.

To test your setup, try sending some MIDI data to Live from your control surface. The Control Bar’s
MIDI indicators will flash whenever Live recognizes an incoming MIDI message.

Once your controller is recognized by Live, you have completed the setup phase (but we recommend
that you take the time to select a Takeover Mode before you leave the Settings behind). Your next step
will be creating MIDI mappings between your control surface and Live. Luckily, this is a simple task,
and you only need to do it for one parameter at a time.

31.1.3 Takeover Mode

MIDI Controller Takeover Mode.

When MIDI controls that send absolute values (such as faders) are used in a bank-switching setup,
where they address a different destination parameter with each controller bank, you will need to
decide how Live should handle the sudden jumps in values that will occur when moving a control for
the first time after switching the bank. Three takeover modes are available:

None — As soon as the physical control is moved, its new value is sent immediately to its destination
parameter, usually resulting in abrupt value changes.

Pick-Up — Moving the physical control has no effect until it reaches the value of its destination
parameter. As soon as they are equal, the destination value tracks the control’s value 1:1. This option
can provide smooth value changes, but it can be difficult to estimate exactly where the pick-up will
take place.

Value Scaling — This option ensures smooth value transitions. It compares the physical control’s value
to the destination parameter’s value and calculates a smooth convergence of the two as the control is
moved. As soon as they are equal, the destination value tracks the control’s value 1:1.

31.2 The Mapping Browser

The Mapping Browser.

All manual MIDI, computer keyboard and Macro Control mappings are managed by the Mapping
Browser. The Mapping Browser is hidden until one of the three mapping modes is enabled. It will then
display all mappings for the current mode. For each mapping, it lists the control element, the path to
the mapped parameter, the parameter’s name, and the mapping’s Min and Max value ranges. The
assigned Min and Max ranges can be edited at any time, and can be quickly inverted with a context
menu command. Delete mappings using your computer’s Backspace (Win) or Delete (Mac) key.

Note that Instant Mappings are context based and are not displayed in the Mapping Browser. Their
mapping structure can be displayed while working in Live by choosing the Help View option from the
Help menu and then opening the Control Surface Reference lesson.

31.2.1 Assigning MIDI Remote Control

The MIDI Map Mode Switch.

Once your remote control setup has been defined in the Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings, giving MIDI
controllers and notes remote control assignments is simple:

1.

Enter MIDI Map Mode by pressing the MIDI switch in Live’s upper right-hand corner. Notice
that assignable elements of the interface become highlighted in blue, and that the Mapping
Browser becomes available. If your browser is closed, Ctrl
Option

B (Win) / Cmd

B (Mac) will open it for you.

Alt

2.
3.

4.

Click on the Live parameter that you’d like to control via MIDI.
Send a MIDI message by pressing a keyboard key, turning a knob, etc., on your MIDI
controller. You will see that this new MIDI mapping is now listed in the Mapping Browser.
Exit MIDI Map Mode by pressing the MIDI switch once again. The Mapping Browser will
disappear, but you can always review your mappings by entering MIDI Map Mode again.

31.2.2 Mapping to MIDI Notes

MIDI notes send simple Note On and Note Off messages to Live’s interface elements. These messages
can produce the following effects on controls in Live:

•

•
•
•

Session View Slots — Note On and Note Off messages affect clips in the slot according to their
Launch Mode settings.
Switches — A Note On message toggles the switch’s state.
Radio Buttons — Note On messages toggle through the available options.
Variable Parameters — When assigned to a single note, Note On messages toggle the
parameter between its Min and Max values. When assigned to a range of notes, each note is
assigned a discrete value, equally spaced over the parameter’s range of values.

Session View slots can be assigned to a MIDI note range for chromatic playing: First play the root key
(this is the key that will play the clip at its default transposition), and then, while holding down the root
key, hold one key below the root and one above it to define the limits of the range.

31.2.3 Mapping to Absolute MIDI Controllers

Absolute MIDI controllers send messages to Live in the form of absolute values ranging from 0 to 127.
These values lead to different results depending on the type of Live control to which they are assigned.
A value message of 127, for example, might turn the Volume control on a Live track all the way up or

play a Session View clip. Specifically, MIDI controller messages from 0 to 127 can produce the
following effects on controls in Live:

•

•

•

•

Session View Slots — Controller values 64 and above are treated like Note On messages.
Controller values 63 and below are treated like Note Off messages.
Switches — For track activators and on/off buttons in devices, controller values that are within
the mapping’s Min and Max range turn the switch on. Controller values that are above or
below this range turn it off. You can reverse this behavior by setting a Min value that is higher
than its corresponding Max value. In this case, controller values that are outside of the range
turn the switch on, while values inside the range turn it off. For all other switches (such as
transport controls), controller values 64 and above turn the switch on, while controller values
below 64 turn it off.
Radio Buttons — The controller’s 0…127 value range is mapped onto the range of available
options.
Continuous Controls — The controller’s 0…127 value range is mapped onto the parameter’s
range of values.

Live also supports pitch bend messages and high-precision (”14-bit Absolute”) controller messages
with a 0…16383 value range. The above specifications apply to these as well, except that the value
range’s center is at 8191/8192.

31.2.4 Mapping to Relative MIDI Controllers

Some MIDI controllers can send ”value increment” and ”value decrement” messages instead of
absolute values. These controls prevent parameter jumps when the state of a control in Live and the
corresponding control on the hardware MIDI controller differ. For example, imagine that you have
assigned the pan knob on your control surface to the pan parameter of a track in Live. If the hardware
control is panned hard right, and the Live control is panned hard left, a slight movement in a hardware
pan knob that sends absolute values would tell Live to pan right, causing an abrupt jump in the track’s
panning. A pan knob sending relative messages would prevent this, since its incremental message to
Live would simply say, ”Pan slightly to the left of your current position.”

There are four types of relative controllers: Signed Bit, Signed Bit 2, Bin Offset and Twos Complement.

Each of these are also available in a ”linear” mode. Some MIDI encoders use ”acceleration”
internally, generating larger changes in value when they are turned quickly. For control surfaces that
are not natively supported, Live tries to detect the controller type and whether acceleration is being
used or not.

You can improve the detection process by moving the relative controller slowly to the left when you
make an assignment. Live will offer its suggestion in the Status Bar’s ”mode” chooser, but if you
happen to know the relative controller type, you can manually select it.

Live will do the following with relative MIDI controller messages:

•

Session View Slots — Value increment messages are treated like Note On messages. Value
decrement messages are treated like Note Off messages.

•
•

•

Switches — Increment messages turn the switch on. Decrement messages turn it off.
Radio Buttons — Increment messages make the radio button jump forward to the next available
option. Decrement messages make it jump backward.
Continuous Controls — Each type of relative MIDI controller uses a different interpretation of
the 0…127 MIDI controller value range to identify value increments and decrements.

Please consult the documentation that came with your MIDI controller if you need further information
on relative MIDI controllers.

31.2.4.1 Relative Session View Navigation

Notice that you can make not only absolute mappings to individual slots and scenes, but also relative
mappings to move the highlighted scene and operate on the highlighted clips.

In both MIDI Map Mode and Key Map Mode, a strip of assignable controls appears below the
Session grid:

The Relative Session Mapping Strip.

1.
2.

3.

4.
5.

Assign these buttons to keys, notes or controllers to move the highlighted scene up and down.
Assign this scene number value box to a MIDI controller — preferably an endless encoder — to
scroll through the scenes. For details, see the previous section on Relative Map Modes.
Assign this button to launch the highlighted scene. If the Record, Warp & Launch Settings’ Select
Next Scene on Launch option is checked, you can move successively (and hopefully
successfully!) through the scenes.
Assign this button to cancel the launch of a triggered scene.
Assign these buttons to launch the clip at the highlighted scene, in the respective track.

Relative Session mapping is useful for navigating a large Live Set, as Live always keeps the
highlighted scene at the Session View’s center.

31.2.4.2 Mapping to Clip View Controls

The Clip View displays the settings for whichever clip happens to be currently selected, but it will also
display the settings of multi-selected clips. To avoid unpleasant musical surprises, it is important to
remember that creating remote control mappings for any control in the Clip View interface could

potentially affect any clip in the Live Set. For this reason, we recommend mapping Clip View controls
to relative MIDI controllers to prevent undesirable jumps in parameter values.

31.2.5 Computer Keyboard Remote Control

The Key Map Mode Switch.

Creating control surface assignments for your computer keyboard is straightforward:

1.

2.

3.

4.

Enter Key Map Mode by pressing the KEY switch in the upper right-hand corner of the Live
screen. Notice that the assignable elements of the interface become highlighted in red when
you enter Key Map Mode. The Mapping Browser will also become available. If the Browser is
hidden, you will want to show it at this point using the appropriate View menu command.
Click on the Live parameter that you wish to assign to a key. Remember that only the controls
that are shown with a red overlay are available for mapping.
Press the computer key to which you wish to assign the control. The details of your new
mapping will be displayed in the Mapping Browser.
Leave Key Map Mode by pressing Live’s KEY switch once again. The Mapping Browser will
disappear, but your mappings can be reviewed at any time simply by entering Key Map Mode
again.

Keyboard assignments can produce the following effects in Live:

•

•
•

Clips in Session View slots will be affected by mapped keys according to their Launch Mode
settings.
Keys assigned to switches will toggle switch states.
Keys assigned to radio buttons will toggle through the available options.

Please be sure not to confuse this remote control functionality with Live’s ability to use the computer
keyboard as a pseudo-MIDI keyboard that can generate MIDI notes from computer keystrokes for
use with instruments.

32. Using Push 1

Ableton Push 1 is an instrument for song creation that provides hands-on control of melody and
harmony, beats, sounds, and song structure. In the studio, Push 1 allows you to quickly create clips
that populate Live’s Session View as you work entirely from the hardware. On stage, Push 1 serves as
a powerful instrument for clip launching.

Push 1’s controls are divided into a number of sections, as shown in the diagram below.

Overview of Push 1’s Controls.

Much of Push 1’s behavior depends on which mode it is in, as well as on which type of track is
selected. To help you learn how to work with Push 1, this chapter will walk you through some of the
fundamental workflows, and then will provide a reference of all of Push 1’s controls.

There are also a number of videos that will help you get started with Push 1. These are available at
https://www.ableton.com/learn-push/

32.1 Setup

Setting up the Push 1 hardware is mostly automatic. As long as Live is running, Push 1 will be
automatically detected as soon as it is connected to a USB port on your computer. After connection,
Push 1 can be used immediately. It is not necessary to install drivers and Push 1 does not need to be
manually configured in Live’s Settings.

32.2 Browsing and Loading Sounds

You can browse and load sounds directly from Push 1, without needing to use Live’s browser. This is
done in Push 1’s Browse Mode.

Press Push 1’s Browse button:

The Browse Button.

In Browse Mode, the display shows all of your available sounds and effects, as well as locations from
the Places section of Live’s browser. The display is divided into columns. The far left column shows
either the specific type of device being browsed or the Places label. Each column to the right shows
the next subfolder (if any exist). Use the In and Out buttons to shift the display to the right or left,
allowing you to browse deeper levels of subfolders or view a larger number of presets on the display.

In and Out Buttons.

Navigate up via the Selection Control button (the first row below the display) in each column.
Navigate down one folder via the State Control button for each level (the second row below the
display). Samples and presets from official Packs or Live’s Core Library will preview when selected in
the browser. To load a device preset, press the green button on the right. To load the default preset of
the selected device, press the green button on the left.

Loading Devices or Device Presets in Browse Mode.

You can scroll quickly through folders and subfolders via the encoders. Holding Shift while pressing
the up or down buttons will move by a whole page.

After pressing a device or preset load button, the button will turn amber. This indicates that the
currently selected entry is loaded; if you navigate to a different entry, the button will turn green again.
Pressing an amber load button will load the next entry in the list, allowing you to quickly try out
presets or devices.

What you see when in Browse Mode depends on the device that was last selected. If you were
working with an instrument, Browse Mode will show you replacement instruments. If you were
working with an effect, you will see effects. When starting with an empty MIDI track, the display
shows all of your available sounds, instruments, drum kits, effects, and Max for Live device, as well as
VST and Audio Units plug-ins. Folders are only visible on Push 1 if they contain items that can be
loaded at any particular time. For example, the Samples label (as well as any of your own folders in
Places that only contain samples) won’t be visible unless you’re browsing from a single pad in a Drum
Rack.

32.3 Playing and Programming Beats

To create beats using Push 1, first make sure Note Mode is enabled.

The Note Mode Button.

Then use Browse Mode to load one of the Drum Rack presets from Live’s library.

When working with a MIDI track containing a Drum Rack, Push 1’s 8x8 pad grid can be configured in
a few different ways, depending on the state of the Note button. Pressing this button cycles between
three different modes.

32.3.1 Loop Selector

When the Loop Selector layout is enabled, the pads are divided into three sections, allowing you to
simultaneously play, step sequence and adjust the length of your clip.

The Pad Grid When Working With Drums

The 16 Drum Rack pads are laid out, like Live’s Drum Rack, in the classic 4x4 arrangement, allowing
for real-time playing. The Drum Rack pad colors indicate the following:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Bright yellow — this pad contains a sound.
Dull yellow — this pad is empty.
Green — this pad is currently-playing.
Light Blue — this pad is selected.
Dark blue — this pad is soloed.
Orange— this pad is muted.

When working with Drum Racks that contain a larger number of pads, use Push 1’s touch strip or the
Octave Up and Octave Down keys to move up/down by 16 pads. Hold Shift while using the touch
strip or Octave keys to move by single rows.

Holding the Note button gives you momentary access to the 16 Velocities layout. You can also lock
the alternate layout in place by holding Shift and pressing the Note button. To unlock the 16 Velocities
layout, press the Note button again.

Octave Up/Down Buttons.

32.3.2 16 Velocities Mode

Press the Layout button to switch to the 16 Velocities layout. In this mode, the bottom right 16 pads
represent 16 different velocities for the selected Drum Rack pad. Tap one of the velocity pads to enter
steps at that velocity.

Holding the Note button gives you momentary access to the loop length controls. You can also lock
the loop length controls in place by holding Shift and pressing the Note button. To unlock the loop
length pads, press the Note button again.

32.3.3 64-Pad Mode

In addition to the Loop Selector and 16 Velocities layouts, you can also use the entire 8x8 pad grid
for real-time drum playing. This is useful when working with very large drum kits, such as those created
by slicing. To toggle to 64-pad mode, press the Note Mode button a second time. Pressing Note
again will then toggle back to the Loop Selector layout, allowing you to quickly get back to step
sequencing. The pad colors in 64-pad mode are the same as those used in the three-section layout.

When moving back and forth between the three layouts, the 16 pads available for step sequencing
will not change automatically. You may still need to use the touch strip or Octave keys in order to see
the specific 16 pads you want.

Holding the Note button gives you momentary access to the loop length controls. You can also lock
the loop length controls in place by holding Shift and pressing the Note button. To unlock the loop
length pads, press the Note button again.

32.3.4 Loading Individual Drums

Browse Mode can also be used to load or replace individual pads within a loaded Drum Rack. To
switch between browsing Drum Racks and single pads, press the Device button to show the devices
on the track.

Device Button.

By default, the Drum Rack is selected, as indicated by the arrow in the display. To select an individual
pad instead, tap that pad, then press the selection button below the pad’s name.

Selecting an Individual Pad in a Drum Rack.

Now, entering Browse Mode again will allow you to load or replace the sound of only the selected
pad. Once in Browse Mode, tapping other pads will select them for browsing, allowing you to quickly
load or replace multiple sounds within the loaded Drum Rack.

32.3.4.1 Additional Pad Options for Push 1

To copy a pad to a different location in your Drum Rack, hold the Duplicate button and press the pad
you’d like to copy. While continuing to hold Duplicate, press the pad where you’d like to paste the
copied pad. Note that this will replace the destination pad’s devices (and thus its sound) but will not
replace any existing notes already recorded for that pad.

32.3.5 Step Sequencing Beats

Tapping a pad also enables it for step sequencing. To select a pad without playing it, press and hold
the Select button while tapping a pad.

Select Button.

To record notes with the step sequencer, tap the pads in the step sequencer controls to place notes in
the clip where you want them. The clip will begin playing as soon as you tap a step. By default, each
step sequencer pad corresponds to a 16th note, but you can change the step size via the buttons in
the Scene/Grid section.

Scene/Grid Buttons.

As the clip plays, the currently playing step is indicated by the moving green pad in the step
sequencer section. When Record is enabled, the moving pad will be red. Tapping a step that already
has a note will delete that note. Press and hold the Mute button while tapping a step to deactivate it
without deleting it. Press and hold Solo button while tapping a pad to solo that sound.

Mute and Solo Buttons.

You can also adjust the velocity and micro-timing of individual notes, as described in the section on
step sequencing automation.

To delete all notes for a pad, press and hold Delete while tapping the pad. Note that this will only
delete notes that are within the current loop.

Delete Button.

The pad colors in the step sequencer section indicate the following:

•
•
•
•

Unlit — this step doesn’t contain a note.
Blue — this step contains a note. Darker blues indicate higher velocities.
Dull yellow — this step contains a note, but the note is muted.
Light Red — the right two columns of pads will turn red if triplets are selected as the step size. In
this case, these pads are not active; only the first six pads in each row of steps can be used.

When Triplets are Selected, the Red Steps are Unavailable.

For detailed information about adjusting the loop length pads, see the section called Adjusting the
Loop Length.

32.3.6 Real-time Recording

Drum patterns can also be recorded in real-time by playing the Drum Rack pads. Follow these steps to
record in real-time:

•

If you want to record with a click track, press the Metronome button to enable Live’s built-in
click

Metronome Button.

•

Then Press the Record button to begin recording

Record Button.

Now any Drum Rack pads you play will be recorded to the clip. Pressing Record again will stop
recording but will continue playing back the clip. Pressing Record a third time will enable overdub
mode, allowing you to record into the clip while it plays back. Subsequent presses continue to toggle
between playback and overdub.

Pressing New stops playback of the currently selected clip and prepares Live to record a new clip on
the currently selected track. This allows you to practice before recording a new idea. By default,
pressing New also duplicates all clips that are playing on other tracks to a new scene and continues
playing them back seamlessly. This behavior can be changed by changing the Workflow mode in
Push 1’s User Preferences.

New Button.

32.3.7 Fixed Length Recording

Press the Fixed Length button to set the size of new clips to a predetermined length.

Fixed Length Button.

Press and hold Fixed Length to set the recording length.

Fixed Length Recording Options.

When Fixed Length is disabled, new clips will continue to record until you press the Record, New or
Play/Stop buttons.

Enabling Fixed Length while recording will switch recording off and loop the last few bars of the clip,
depending on the Fixed Length setting.

32.4 Additional Recording Options

32.4.1 Recording with Repeat

With Push 1’s Repeat button enabled, you can hold down a pad to play or record a stream of
continuous, rhythmically-even notes. This is useful for recording steady hi-hat patterns, for example.
Varying your finger pressure on the pad will change the volume of the repeated notes.

Repeat Button.

The repeat rate is set with the Scene/Grid buttons. Note that Push 1 “remembers” the Repeat button’s
state and setting for each track.

If you press and release Repeat quickly, the button will stay on. If you press and hold, the button will
turn off when released, allowing for momentary control of repeated notes.

Turn up the Swing knob to apply swing to the repeated notes. When you touch the knob, the display
will show the amount of swing.

Swing Knob.

32.4.2 Quantizing

Pressing Push 1’s Quantize button will snap notes to the grid in the selected clip.

Quantize Button.

Press and hold Quantize to change the quantization options:

Quantization Options.

Swing Amount determines the amount of swing that will be applied to the quantized notes. Note that
the Swing amount can be adjusted from Encoder 1 or from the dedicated Swing knob.

Quantize To sets the nearest note value to which notes will be quantized, while Quantize Amount
determines the amount that notes can be moved from their original positions.

Enable Record Quantize to automatically quantize notes while recording and adjust the record
quantization value with Encoder 8. Note that these controls correspond to the settings of the Record
Quantization chooser in Live’s Edit menu, and adjustments can be made from Live or from Push 1.

When working with drums, press and hold Quantize and press a Drum Rack pad to quantize only that
drum’s notes in the current clip.

32.5 Playing Melodies and Harmonies

After working on a beat, you’ll want to create a new track so that you can work on a bassline,
harmony parts, etc. Press the Add Track button to add a new MIDI track to your Live Set.

Add Track Button.

Press and hold the Add Track button to select between Audio, MIDI and Return tracks.

Adding a track puts Push 1 into Browse mode, so you can immediately load an instrument. After
loading your instrument, make sure Note Mode is enabled.

Note that when pressing the Add Track button while a track within a Group Track is selected, any new
tracks will be inserted into that Group Track.

When working with a MIDI track containing an instrument, Push 1’s 8x8 pad grid automatically
configures itself to play notes. By default, every note on the grid is in the key of C major. The bottom
left pad plays C1 (although you can change the octave with the Octave Up and Down buttons).
Moving upward, each pad is a fourth higher. Moving to the right, each pad is the next note in the C
major scale.

Play a major scale by playing the first three pads in the first row, then the first three pads in the next
row upwards. Continue until you reach the next C:

C Major Scale.

The pad colors help you to stay oriented as you play:

•
•
•
•

Blue — this note is the root note of the key (e.g., C).
White — this note is in the scale, but is not the root.
Green — the currently-playing note (other pads will also turn green if they play the same note).
Red — the currently-playing note when recording.

To play triads, try out the following shape anywhere on the grid:

C Major Chord.

Holding the Note button gives you momentary access to the loop length controls, which appear in the
top row of pads. You can lock the loop length controls in place by holding Shift and pressing the Note
button. To unlock the loop length pads, press the Note button again.

32.5.1 Playing in Other Keys

Press Push 1’s Scales button to change the selected key and/or scale.

Scales Button.

Using the display and the Selection and State Control buttons, you can change the key played by the
pad grid. The currently selected key is marked with an arrow in the display:

By default, the pads and scale selection options indicate major scales. You can change to a variety of
other scale types using the first encoder, or the two buttons below the display on the far left. The
selected scale type is also marked with an arrow.

Key and Scale Selection.

In addition to changing the key, you can also change the layout of the grid using the two buttons on
the far right.

Fixed Y/N: When Fixed Mode is on, the notes on the pad grid remain in the same positions when you
change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play C, except in keys that don’t contain a C, in which
case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in the key. When Fixed is off, the notes on the pad
grid shift so that the bottom-left pad always plays the root of the selected key.

In Key/Chromatic: With In Key selected, the pad grid is effectively “folded” so that only notes within
the key are available. In Chromatic Mode, the pad grid contains all notes. Notes that are in the key
are lit, while notes that are not in the key are unlit.

Holding the Shift button while in Scales mode allows you to access a number of additional note
layout options.

Additional Note Layout Options.

The “4th” and “3rd “options refer to the note interval that the grid is based on, while the ^ and >
symbols refer to the rotation of the grid. For example, the default layout is “4th ^” which means that
each row of pads is a 4th higher than the row below it. The “4th >” option is also built on 4ths, but
now moves to the right rather than upwards; each column is a 4th higher than the column to the left.
The “Sequent” options lay out all notes in order. These options are useful if you need a very large
range of notes available, because they have no duplicated notes.

The last settings that you chose in the Scale options (key, scale type, In Key/Chromatic, and Fixed Y/
N) are saved with the Set. Push 1 will return to these settings when the Set is reloaded again.

All of the real-time recording options available for drums are also available for melodies and
harmonies, including fixed length recording, recording with repeat, and quantizing. But for detailed
editing, you’ll work with the melodic step sequencer described in the next section.

One editing possibility is available in the real-time Note Mode: to quickly delete all notes of the same
pitch within the current loop, press and hold Delete and then tap the respective pad.

32.6 Step Sequencing Melodies and Harmonies

In addition to playing and recording in real time, you can also step sequence your melodies and
harmonies. To toggle to the Melodic Sequencer, press the Note Mode button a second time. This will
set the 8x8 pad grid as follows:

The Pad Grid When Step Sequencing Pitches.

When using the Melodic Sequencer, all eight rows of pads allow you to place notes in the clip. You
can adjust the loop length and access additional step sequencing pages via the loop length pads. The
loop length pads can be momentarily accessed in the top row while holding the Note button.

You can also lock the loop length pads in place. To do this, hold Shift and tap the Note button. Note
that Push 1 remembers this locked/unlocked state for each track. To unlock the loop length pads,
press the Note button again.

With In Key selected, each row corresponds to one of the available pitches in the currently selected
scale. With Chromatic selected, notes that are in the key are lit, while notes that are not in the key are
unlit. The light blue row (which is the bottom row by default) indicates the root of the selected key.
Each column of pads represents a step in the resolution set by the Scene/Grid buttons.

As with the real-time playing layout, pressing the Octave Up and Down button shifts the range of
available notes. You can also use the touch strip to change the range. Hold the Shift key while
adjusting the touch strip or pressing the Octave buttons to fine tune the pitch range. After adjusting the
pitch range or when switching between the real-time and step sequencing layouts, the display will
briefly show the available range.

The Display Shows the Range of Available Notes.

Additionally, brightly-lit touch strip lights indicate the currently available note range, while dimly-lit
touch strip lights indicate that the clip contains notes within the corresponding note range.

Pressing Note again will toggle to the Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes layout.

In addition to adding and removing notes, you can also adjust the velocity and micro-timing of the
notes, as described in the section on step sequencing automation.

32.6.1 Adjusting the Loop Length

The loop length controls allow you to set the length of the clip’s loop and determine which part of it
you can see and edit in the melodic and drum step sequencers. Each loop length pad corresponds to
a page of steps, and the length of a page depends on the step resolution. When working with drums
at the default 16th note resolution, two pages of steps are available at a time, for a total of two bars.
In the Melodic Sequencer layout, one page of eight steps is available at a time, for a total of two
beats. To change the loop length, hold one pad and then tap another pad or, to set the loop length to
exactly one page, quickly double-tap the corresponding pad.

Each Loop Length Pad Corresponds to One Page.

Note that the page you see is not necessarily the page you hear. When you set the loop length, the
pages will update so that the current play position (as indicated by the moving green pad in the step
sequencer section) always remains visible. But in some cases, you may want to disable this auto-
follow behavior. For example, you may want to edit a single page of a longer loop, while still
allowing the loop to play for the length you set. To do this, single-tap the pad that corresponds to that
page. This will “lock” the view to that page without changing the loop length. To then turn auto-follow
back on, simply reselect the current loop. Note that single-tapping a page that is outside of the current
loop will immediately set the loop to that page.

The pad colors in the loop length section indicate the following:

•
•
•
•

Unlit — this page is outside of the loop.
White — this page is within the loop, but is not currently visible in the step sequencer section.
Dull yellow — this page is visible in the step sequencer section, but is not currently playing.
Green — this is the currently playing page.

If you need to access the loop length pads frequently, you can lock them in place. To do this, hold
Shift and tap the Note button. Note that Push 1 remembers this locked/unlocked state for each track.
To unlock the loop length pads, press the Note button again.

To duplicate the contents of a sequencer page, hold Duplicate, press the loop length pad for the page
you want to duplicate, and press the loop length pad for the destination page. Note that this will not
remove existing notes in the destination page, but will add copied notes on top. To remove notes first,
hold Delete and tap the loop length pad for that page.

32.7 Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes

The Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes layout combines both step sequencing and real-time playing
capabilities. Providing access to multiple octaves and steps on a single page, this layout is ideal for
figuring out chords and harmonies to sequence. It is also well suited to longer phrases.

32.7.1 32 Notes

The bottom half of the pad grid lets you play notes in real-time, and select them for step sequencing.
Each pad corresponds to one of the available pitches in the currently selected scale. Pressing a pad
will select and play the note. Selected notes are represented by a lighter version of the track’s color.

To select a pad without triggering it, press and hold the Select button while tapping a pad.

The pad colors indicate the following:

•
•
•
•

Blue — this note is the root note of the scale.
Blue-Green — this pad is selected.
Green — this pad is currently playing.
White — this note is in the scale, but is not the root.

Pressing the Octave Up or Down button shifts the range of available notes. Holding the Shift key while
adjusting the touch strip shifts the range by octaves. You can hold the Shift key while pressing the
Octave buttons to shift by one note in the scale. The display will briefly show the available range as
you adjust it.

As with the 64 Notes layout, the notes in the bottom half of the pad grid can be adjusted via the Scale
menu.

32.7.2 Sequencer

Tapping a step in the top half of the pad grid adds all selected notes to that step. Steps containing
notes are displayed in a blue color.

Holding a step lets you view notes contained within the step, which are indicated in the bottom half of
the pad grid by a blue-green color. Tapping any of these selected notes will remove it from the step.

Holding multiple steps will add selected notes to all those steps. While holding Duplicate, you can
press a step to copy the notes in that step and then press another step to paste them to a new location
in the step sequencer. Note that this will not remove existing notes in the destination page, but will add
copied notes on top. To remove notes first, hold Delete and tap the loop length pad for that page.

The pad colors in the step sequencer indicate the following:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Blue — this step contains a note.
Green — this step is currently playing.
White — this step is selected.
Dull Yellow — this step contains a note, but the note is muted.
Gray — this pad is empty.
Light Red — the right two columns of pads will be unlit if triplets are selected as the step size. In
this case, these pads are not active; only the first six pads in each row of steps can be used.

When working with the sequencer at the default 16th note resolution, two pages of steps are
available at a time, for a total of two bars. You can adjust the loop length and access additional step
sequencing pages via the loop length pads. The loop length pads can be momentarily accessed in the
fifth row while holding the Note button.

You can also lock the loop length pads in place. To do this, hold Shift and tap the Note button. Note
that Push 1 remembers this locked/unlocked state for each track. To unlock the loop length pads,
press the Note button again.

To duplicate the contents of a sequencer page, hold Duplicate, press the loop length pad for the page
you want to duplicate, and press the loop length pad for the destination page. Note that this will not
remove existing notes in the destination page, but will add copied notes on top. To remove notes first,
hold Delete and tap the loop length pad for that page.

32.8 Navigating in Note Mode

Now that you’ve created a few tracks, you can continue to add more. But you may want to move
between already-existing tracks to continue working on musical ideas using those instruments and
devices. The Arrow Keys allow you to do this.

Arrow Keys.

The Left/Right Arrows move between tracks. Note that selecting a MIDI track on Push 1 automatically
arms it, so it can be played immediately. In Live, track Arm buttons will appear pink to indicate that
they have been armed via selection.

Pink Track Arm Button.

The specific behavior of the Up/Down Arrows is determined by the Workflow mode, which is set in
Push 1’s User Preferences. In both modes, the Up/Down Arrows move up or down by a single scene.
In Scene Workflow, the selected scene is triggered. In Clip Workflow, only the selected track’s clip is
triggered. Clips in other tracks are not affected.

Navigating with the Up/Down Arrows in Note Mode always begins playback immediately, and a
triggered clip will take over the play position from whatever clip was played in that track before. Note
that this is the same behavior as if the clips were set to Legato Mode in Live.

32.9 Controlling Live’s Instruments and Effects

Pressing the Device button puts Push 1 in Device Mode, which allows Push 1’s encoders to control
parameters in Live’s devices.

Device Button.

In Device Mode, the Selection Control buttons select devices in the currently selected track, while the
State Control buttons turn the selected device on or off. The currently selected device is marked with
an arrow in the display.

Device Mode Settings.

The In and Out buttons allow you to navigate to additional devices and parameters that may not be
immediately available.

In and Out Buttons.

Use these buttons to access:

•
•

Additional banks of parameters (for effects that have more than one bank of parameters).
Additional device chains within Racks that contain more than one chain.

32.10 Mixing with Push 1

To control volumes, pans, or sends with the encoders for up to eight tracks simultaneously, press the
corresponding button on Push 1. Hold Shift while adjusting the encoders for fine-tune control.

Volume and Pan & Send Buttons.

In Volume Mode, the encoders control track volume.

Pressing the Pan & Send button repeatedly will cycle between controlling pans and however many
sends are available in your Live Set.

Press Push 1’s Track button to enable Track Mode.

Track Button.

In Track Mode, the encoders control track volume, pan and the first six sends of the selected track.
Press the Selection Control buttons to select which track will be controlled in Track Mode.

Selecting Tracks in Track Mode.

Press the Master button to select the Main track.

Press and hold a Group Track’s Selection Control button to unfold or fold the track.

Note that when Split Stereo Pan Mode is active while in Pan & Send Mode, the display will show the
current pan value, but the pan dial will be disabled. In Track Mode, the display will show either the
pan control or stereo pan sliders, depending on the active pan mode.

32.11 Recording Automation

Changes that you make to device and mixer parameters can be recorded to your clips as automation,
so that the sound will change over time as the clip plays. To record automation, press Push 1’s
Automation button.

Automation Button.

This toggles Live’s Session Automation Arm button, allowing you to record changes you make to Push
1’s encoders as part of the clip. When you’re done recording parameter changes, press the
Automation button again to turn it off. To delete the changes you’ve recorded for a particular
parameter, press and hold the Delete button and touch the corresponding encoder. If automation
hasn’t been recorded for a parameter, holding Delete and touching an encoder will reset the
corresponding parameter to its default value.

Automated parameters are shown with a rectangle next to the parameter name in the display.
Parameters that you have overridden (by manually adjusting the parameter while not recording) will
show their value in brackets.

Automated and/or Overridden Parameters are Indicated in the Display.

To reenable all automation that you have manually overridden press and hold Shift and press the
Automation button.

32.12 Step Sequencing Automation

In both the drum and melodic step sequencers, it’s possible to automate parameters for the selected
step.

The parameters that are available will change depending on the display mode you are currently in, as
explained in the following sections.

32.12.1 Note-Specific Parameters

When working in any sequencing layout in Clip Mode, you can adjust note settings for each step. To
access these settings, simply press and hold a step. The display will switch the controls to the step’s
note settings.

Hold a Step to Adjust Note and Automation Parameters.

You can then adjust the corresponding encoders in order to:

•

•
•
•

Nudge notes backwards or forwards in time. The value represents the percentage that the note
is offset from the previous grid line. Negative values indicate that the note occurs before the
grid line.
Adjust the coarse Length of the selected notes.
Fine-tune the length adjustment of the selected notes
Change the Velocity of the selected notes.

You can also adjust these note-specific parameters for multiple steps at the same time. To do this, press
and hold all of the pads you’d like to adjust, and then tweak the encoders. The display will show the
range of values for the selected steps.

With Multiple Steps Selected, the Display Shows the Range of Parameter Values.

You can also create notes with your desired Nudge, Length, and Velocity values by holding an empty
step and then tweaking any of these encoders.

When working with drums, you can adjust nudge, length, and velocity for every note played by a
particular pad by pressing and holding the Select button, pressing the pad, and then adjusting the
encoders.

Hold Select and Press a Drum Pad to Tweak All Notes Played by that Pad.

In both the drum and melodic step sequencers, you can copy a step (including all of its note-specific
parameters) and paste it to another step. To do this, hold Duplicate and tap the step you’d like to
copy. Then tap the destination step and release Duplicate.

32.12.2 Per-Step Automation

When in Device Mode or Volume Mode, hold one or more steps in order to create and edit device or
mixer automation for only the selected step(s). While holding a step and tweaking an encoder, the
corresponding parameter’s automation value will be adjusted specifically for the time represented by
that step. Note that per-step automation can be created for any step, even if that step doesn’t contain
notes.

32.13 Controlling Live’s Session View

Press Push 1’s Session button to switch from Note Mode to Session Mode. You can press and hold the
Session button to temporarily toggle Session Mode. Releasing the button will then return to Note
Mode. Likewise, pressing and holding Note while in Session Mode will temporarily toggle Note
Mode.

Session Button.

In Session Mode, the 8x8 pad grid will now launch clips and the Scene/Grid Buttons will launch
scenes. Pressing a pad triggers the clip in the corresponding location in Live’s Session View. If the track
is selected, pressing the button records a new clip.

The pads light up in different colors so you know what’s going on:

•
•
•

The color of all non-playing clips in your Live Set is reflected on the pads.
Playing clips pulse green to white.
Recording clips pulse red to white.

You can stop all music in a track by enabling Stop Mode and pressing that track’s State Control
button.

Stopping Clip Playback.

To stop all clips, press and hold Shift, and then press Stop.

Push 1 tells you what’s going on in the software, but, importantly, the software also reflects what’s
happening on the hardware. The clip slots currently being controlled by Push 1’s pad grid are shown
in Live with a colored border.

The directional arrows and Shift button increase the scope of the eight-by-eight grid.

•

•

Pressing Up or Down moves you up or down one scene at a time. Hold the Shift button while
hitting Up or Down to move eight scenes up or down. You can also use the Octave Up and
Down buttons to move by eight scenes at a time.
The Left and Right arrow keys move you left or right one track at a time. Hold the Shift button
while hitting Left or Right to move eight tracks at a time.

32.13.1 Session Overview

Push 1’s Session Overview lets you navigate through large Live Sets quickly without looking at your
computer screen. Hold down the Shift button and the pad grid zooms out to reveal an overview of
your Session View. In the Session Overview, each pad represents an eight-scene-by-eight-track block
of clips, giving you a matrix of 64 scenes by 64 tracks. Hit a pad to focus on that section of the
Session View. For example, holding the Shift button and then pressing the pad in row three, column
one will put the focus on scenes 17-24 and tracks 1-8. Furthermore, while Shift is held, each scene
launch button represents a block of 64 scenes, if they are available in your Set.

In the Session Overview, the color coding is a little different:

•

•

Amber: indicates the currently selected block of clips, which will be surrounded by the colored
border in the software.
Green: there are clips playing in that block of clips (though that may not be the block of clips
selected).

•
•

Red: there are no clips playing in that range.
No color: there are no tracks or scenes in that range.

32.14 Setting User Preferences

Press and hold the User button to adjust the sensitivity of Push 1’s velocity response, aftertouch, and
other settings.

User Button

User Settings

Pad Threshold sets the softest playing force that will trigger notes. More force is required at higher
settings. Note that at lower settings, notes may trigger accidentally and pads may “stick” on.

Velocity Curve determines how sensitive the pads are when hit with various amounts of force, and
ranges from Linear (a one-to-one relationship between striking force and note velocity) to various
logarithmic curves. Higher Log values provide more dynamic range when playing softly. Lighter
playing styles may benefit from higher Log values. The diagram below demonstrates the various
velocity curves, with striking force on the horizontal axis and note velocity on the vertical axis.

Diagram of Push 1’s Velocity Curves.

The Workflow option determines how Push 1 behaves when the Duplicate, New, or Up/Down arrow
buttons are pressed. Which mode you choose depends on how you like to organize your musical
ideas. In Scene Workflow (which is the default), musical ideas are organized and navigated in
scenes. In Clip Workflow, you’re working with only the currently selected clip.

In Scene Workflow:

•

•

•

Duplicate creates a new scene containing all of the currently playing clips, and seamlessly
switches to playing them back. This is the same as the Capture and Insert Scene command in
Live’s Create menu.
New is identical to Duplicate, except that it does not duplicate the currently selected clip.
Instead, an empty clip slot is prepared, allowing you to create a new idea in the current track.
The Up/Down Arrows move up or down by a single scene. Playback of the clips in the new
scene begins seamlessly.

In Clip Workflow:

•

•

Duplicate creates a copy of the currently selected clip in the next clip slot, while continuing
playback of any currently playing clips in other tracks. Hold Shift while pressing Duplicate to
create a new scene containing all of the currently playing clips.
New prepares an empty clip slot on the currently selected track. Clips in other tracks are not
affected.

•

the Up/Down Arrows move up or down by a single scene. Playback of the currently selected
track’s clip in the new scene begins seamlessly. Clips in other tracks are not affected.

Aftertouch Threshold sets the lowest incoming aftertouch value (from 0-127) that Push will register.
Input values below this level will be ignored, while input values above this level will be scaled across
the entire aftertouch range. For example, if you set the Aftertouch Threshold to 120 and play with an
aftertouch value of 119, nothing will happen. But input values between 120 and 127 will be scaled to
output a value from 0 to 127, as follows:

120 -> 0
121 -> 18
122 -> 36
123 -> 54
124 -> 72
125 -> 90
126 -> 108
127 -> 127

32.15 Push 1 Control Reference

The function of each section and control is explained below.

32.15.0.1 Focus/Navigation Section

Focus/Navigation Section.

Note Mode — When selected, the Pad Section changes its functionality based on the type of track
that is currently selected:

•

MIDI track containing an instrument — the pads plays notes. Pressing Note additional times
toggles between real-time playing and melodic step sequencing.

•

MIDI track containing a Drum Rack — the Pad Section is divided; the lower-left 16 pads play
the Drum Rack, the lower-right 16 pads adjust the loop length of the clip, and the upper four
rows control the step sequencer. Press Note again to toggle to 64-pad mode, allowing you to
play drums across the entire 8x8 pad grid.

Session Mode — When selected, the Pad Section changes to launch clips in Live’s Session View.

Shift — Press and hold Shift while pressing other buttons to access additional functionality.

Arrow Keys — Move through your Live Set (in Session Mode) and between tracks or scenes/clips (in
Note Mode).

Select — In Session Mode, hold Select and press a clip to select the clip without launching it. This will
also display the clip name in the display. In Note Mode, hold Select and press a Drum Rack pad to
select its notes without triggering the pad.

32.15.0.2 Add Section

Add Section.

These buttons add new devices or tracks to your Live Set.

Add Effect — Opens Browse Mode to add a new device to the right of the currently selected device.
Hold Shift while pressing Add Effect to add the new device to the left of the currently selected device.
To add a MIDI Effect, first select the instrument in a track. Then hold Shift while pressing Add Effect.

32.15.0.3 Note Section

Note Section.

These buttons adjust how notes are played on Push 1.

Scales — When Note Mode is on and an instrument track is selected, pressing this button allows you
to select which scale will be played on the pads. Note that this button has no effect when a Drum
Rack track is selected or when in Session Mode.

•

•

•

Fixed Y/N: When Fixed Mode is on, the notes on the pad grid remain in the same positions
when you change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play C, except in keys that don’t
contain a C, in which case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in the key. When Fixed
is off, the notes on the pad grid shift so that the bottom-left pad always plays the root of the
selected key.
In Key/Chromatic: With In Key selected, the pad grid is effectively “folded” so that only notes
within the key are available. In Chromatic Mode, the pad grid contains all notes. Notes that are
in the key are lit, while notes that are not in the key are unlit.
Scale selection: Select the base scale with the up/down buttons on the lefthand side.

User — All of Push 1’s built-in functionality can be disabled via User Mode. This allows Push 1 to be
reprogrammed to control alternate functions in Live or other software. Press and hold the User button
to access a number of configuration options. Push 1’s relative encoders work best in “Relative (2’s
Comp.)” mode. To ensure this mode is selected, turn the encoder slowly to the left during mapping.

Repeat — When Repeat is enabled, holding down a pad will retrigger the note. The Scene/Grid
buttons change the rhythmic value of the repeated note.

Accent — When Accent is enabled, all incoming notes (whether step sequenced or played in real-
time) are played at full velocity. Press and hold Accent to temporarily enable it.

Octave Up/Down — If an instrument track is selected, these buttons shift the pads up or down by
octave. If a Drum Rack is selected, these buttons shift the Drum Rack’s pad overview up or down by
16 pads. In Session Mode, these buttons shift control of the Session View up or down by eight scenes.
These buttons will be unlit if no additional octaves are available.

32.15.0.4 State Control Section

State Control Section.

When working with tracks, the leftmost eight buttons will either stop clips or mute or solo the
corresponding track, depending on which of the three rightmost buttons is pressed (Stop, Mute, or
Solo). When working with devices instead of tracks, the leftmost eight buttons will toggle devices on
and off. These buttons have additional functionality in other modes, e.g., scale selection.

To stop all clips, press and hold Shift, and then press Stop.

32.15.0.5 Selection Control Section

Selection Control Section.

These buttons work in conjunction with the Display/Encoder Section buttons and select what
parameters can be edited by the encoders and shown in the display. The In and Out buttons allow
you to access devices inside Racks or additional parameter banks for devices with more than eight
parameters. In Browse Mode, the In and Out buttons shift the display to the right or left, allowing you
to browse deeper levels of subfolders or view a larger number of presets on the display.

32.15.0.6 Display/Encoder Section

Display/Encoder Section.

The six buttons to the right of the display determine the editing mode of the encoders. In all modes, the
ninth encoder controls the volume of the Main track, or the Pre-Cue volume if Shift is held. Holding
Shift while adjusting any of the first eight encoders allows you to fine-tune whichever parameter is
currently being controlled by that encoder. Note that you can temporarily toggle to a different editing
mode by pressing and holding the corresponding button. Releasing the button will then return to the
previous mode.

Volume Mode.

In Volume Mode, the encoders control volume of the eight selected tracks.

Pan & Send Mode.

In Pan & Send Mode, press once to control pans. Subsequent presses cycle through sends.

Track Mode.

In Track Mode, the encoders control track volume, pan and the first six sends of the selected track.
Select which clip track to control via the eight Selection Control buttons. Press the Master button to
select the Main track.

In Clip Mode, the encoders control various parameters for the selected clip. The parameters depend
on the type of clip selected:

Browse — The encoders scroll through the available devices and presets.

32.15.0.7 Tempo Section

Tempo Section.

Tap Tempo — As you press once every beat, the tempo of the Live Set will follow your tapping. If the
“Start Playback with Tap Tempo” button is enabled in Live’s Record, Warp & Launch Settings, you can
also use tapping to count in: If you are working in a 4/4 signature, it takes four taps to start song
playback at the tapped tempo.

Metronome — Toggles Live’s metronome on or off.

The left encoder adjusts Live’s tempo in increments of one BPM. Holding Shift while adjusting will set
the tempo in increments of .1 BPM.

The right encoder sets the amount of swing applied when Quantizing, Record Quantizing or when
Repeat is pressed.

32.15.0.8 Edit Section

Edit Section.

Undo — Undoes the last action. Press and hold Shift while pressing Undo to Redo. Note that Push 1’s
Undo button applies Live’s Undo functionality, so it will undo actions in your Live Set even if they were
done without using Push 1.

Delete — In Note Mode, this button deletes the selected clip. In Session Mode, hold Delete and then
press a clip to delete that clip. Hold Delete and select a device or track with Push 1’s Selection Control
buttons to delete. Hold Delete and touch an encoder to delete automation controlled by that encoder.
If automation has not been recorded for a particular parameter, holding Delete and touching the
corresponding encoder will reset that parameter to its default value.

Quantize — Press and release to quantize the selected notes (or all notes in the clip if there is no
selection). Hold Quantize and press a drum pad to quantize that pad’s notes. For audio clips,
Quantize will affect transients. Press and hold Quantize to access quantization settings. After
changing these settings, press once to exit and then press and release to apply your changes.

Double — doubles the material within the loop, as well as the length of the loop.

32.15.0.9 Transport Section

Transport Section.

Fixed Length — When enabled, all newly created clips will be a fixed number of bars. When
disabled, new clips will continue to record until you press the Record, New or Play/Stop buttons.
Press and hold, then use the buttons beneath the display to specify the fixed recording length.
Enabling Fixed Length while recording will switch recording off and loop the last few bars of the clip,
depending on the Fixed Length setting.

Automation — Toggles Live’s Automation Record button. When on, your parameter changes will be
recorded into playing Session View clips. Hold Shift and press Automation to reenable any
automation that you have overridden. Hold Delete and press the Automation button to delete all
automation in a clip.

Duplicate — In Scene Workflow, Duplicate creates a new scene containing all of the currently playing
clips. In Clip Workflow, Duplicate creates a copy of the currently selected clip in the next clip slot,
while continuing playback of any currently playing clips in other tracks. Hold Duplicate while pressing
a Drum Rack pad to copy the pad and paste it to a new location in the Drum Rack.

New — Pressing New stops the selected clip and prepares Live to record new material. This allows
you to practice before making a new recording. On armed MIDI tracks, holding Record while
pressing New triggers Capture MIDI.

Record — Press the Record button to begin recording. Pressing Record again will stop recording but
will continue playing back the clip. Pressing Record a third time will enable overdub mode, allowing
you to record into the clip while it plays back.

Play/Stop — Toggles the play button in Live’s transport bar. Hold Shift while pressing Play/Stop to
return Live’s transport to 1.1.1 without starting playback.

32.15.0.10 Touch Strip

Touch Strip.

When an instrument track is selected, the touch strip adjusts pitch bend or modulation wheel amount
when playing in real-time, or the available range of notes when step sequencing. When a Drum Rack
track is selected, the touch strip selects the Drum Rack bank.

Pitch bend is selected by default when an instrument track is selected. To change the functionality of
the touch strip, hold Select and tap the strip. This toggles between pitch bend and mod wheel
functionality each time you tap it. The display will briefly show the current mode each time you change
it. Note that pitch bend and modulation wheel functionality is only available when playing instruments
in real time, and not when using the melodic step sequencers.

32.15.0.11 Pad Section

Pad Section.

The functionality of the Pad Section is determined by the Note and Session Mode buttons. When
Session Mode is on, the Pad Section is used to launch clips in Live’s Session View. When Note Mode
is on, the Pad Section changes its functionality based on the type of track that is currently selected:

•

•

MIDI track containing an instrument — the pads plays notes. Pressing Note additional times
toggles between real-time playing and melodic step sequencing.
MIDI track containing a Drum Rack — the Pad Section is divided; the lower-left 16 pads play
the Drum Rack, the lower-right 16 pads adjust the loop length of the clip, and the upper four
rows control the step sequencer. Press Note again to toggle to 64-pad mode, allowing you to
play drums across the entire 8x8 pad grid.

32.15.0.12 Scene/Grid Section

Scene/Grid Section.

These buttons also change their functionality depending on whether Session Mode or Note Mode is
selected. When Session Mode is selected, these buttons launch Session View scenes. Hold the Select
button while pressing a Scene button to select the scene without launching it. When Note Mode is
selected, the Scene/Grid Section determines the rhythmic resolution of the step sequencer grid and
the rhythmic resolution of repeated notes when Repeat is enabled.

32.15.0.13 Using Footswitches with Push 1

Two ports on the back of Push 1 allow you to connect momentary footswitches. Footswitch 1 acts as a
sustain pedal. Footswitch 2 gives you hands-free control of Push 1’s recording functionality. A single
tap of the footswitch will toggle the Record button, thus switching between recording/overdubbing
and playback of the current clip. Quickly double-tapping the footswitch is the same as pressing the
New button.

Note that certain footswitches may behave “backwards”; for example, notes may sustain only when
the pedal is not depressed. Footswitch polarity can usually be corrected by connecting the footswitch
to the port while depressing it, but we recommend using footswitches with a physical polarity switch.

33. Using Push 2

Ableton Push 2 is an instrument for song creation that provides hands-on control of melody and
harmony, beats, samples, sounds, and song structure. In the studio, Push 2 allows you to quickly
create clips that populate Live’s Session View as you work entirely from the hardware. On stage, Push
2 serves as a powerful instrument for real-time playing, step sequencing, and clip launching.

Overview of Push 2’s Controls.

Much of Push 2’s behavior depends on which mode it is in, as well as on which type of track is
selected. To help you learn how to work with Push 2, this chapter will walk you through some of the
fundamental workflows, and then will provide a reference of all of Push 2’s controls.

There are also a number of videos that will help you get started with Push 2. These are available at
https://www.ableton.com/learn-push/

33.1 Setup

After plugging in the included power supply and connecting the USB cable to your computer, turn
Push 2 on via the power button in the back. From here, setting up the Push 2 hardware is mostly
automatic. As long as Live is running, Push 2 will be automatically detected as soon as it is connected
to a USB port on your computer. After connection, Push 2 can be used almost immediately. It is not
necessary to install drivers and Push 2 does not need to be manually configured in Live’s Settings.

From time to time, Ableton will release firmware updates for Push 2 that will be included in updates to
Live. When using Push 2 for the first time after installing a new version of Live, you may be prompted
to update the firmware. Push 2 will walk you through this process.

33.2 Browsing and Loading Sounds

You can browse and load sounds directly from Push 2, without needing to use Live’s browser. This is
done in Push 2’s Browse Mode.

Press Push 2’s Browse button:

The Browse Button.

The display is divided into columns. When you first enter Browse Mode, the far left column shows
either the specific category of device being browsed or the Collections label, which lets you access
tagged browser items quickly. Each column to the right shows the next subfolder (if any exist) or the
contents of the current folder. You can scroll through presets and folders using the eight encoders
above the display, or navigate through them one at a time via the arrow buttons.

Arrow Buttons.

The display will expand automatically as you navigate. You can load Live’s “default” devices from the
top level of the browser’s hierarchy, and can quickly move up or down in the hierarchy via the
rightmost two upper display buttons.

Navigate Up and Down in the Browser Hierarchy.

By default, samples and presets from official Packs or Live’s Core Library will preview when selected in
the browser. You can toggle preview on or off via the Preview button.

Preview Button.

To adjust the previewing volume, hold the Shift button while turning the Master volume encoder.

Shift Button.

Master Volume Encoder.

To load the selected item, press the Load button.

Loading Items in Browse Mode.

What you see when in Browse Mode depends on the device that was last selected. If you were
working with an instrument, Browse Mode will show you replacement instruments. If you were
working with an effect, you will see effects. When starting with an empty MIDI track, the display
shows all of your available sounds, instruments, drum kits, effects, and Max for Live devices, as well as
VST and Audio Unit plug-ins.

33.3 Playing and Programming Beats

To create beats using Push 2, first make sure Note Mode is enabled

The Note Mode Button.

Then use Browse Mode to navigate to the Drums section of the browser and load one of the Drum
Rack presets from Live’s library.

When working with a MIDI track containing a Drum Rack, Push 2’s 8x8 pad grid can be configured in
a few different ways, depending on the state of the Layout button. Pressing this button cycles between
three different modes.

The Layout Button

33.3.1 Loop Selector

When the Loop Selector layout is enabled, the pads are divided into three sections, allowing you to
simultaneously play, step sequence and adjust the length of your clip.

The Pad Grid with the Loop Selector Layout

The 16 Drum Rack pads are laid out, like Live’s Drum Rack, in the classic 4x4 arrangement, allowing
for real-time playing. Controls in the display and the pads in the Drum Rack match the color of the
track, with subtle variations that help you understand what’s happening. The Drum Rack pad colors
indicate the following:

•
•
•
•
•
•

The track’s color — this pad contains a sound.
Lighter version of the track’s color — this pad is empty.
Green — this pad is currently-playing.
White — this pad is selected.
Dark blue — this pad is soloed.
Gray— this pad is muted.

When working with Drum Racks that contain a larger number of pads, use Push 2’s touch strip or the
Octave Up and Octave Down buttons to move up/down by 16 pads. Hold Shift while using the
touch strip or Octave buttons to move by single rows.

Octave Up/Down Buttons.

Holding the Layout button gives you momentary access to the 16 Velocities layout. You can also lock
the alternate layout in place by holding Shift and pressing the Layout button. To unlock the 16
Velocities layout, press the Layout button again.

33.3.2 16 Velocities Mode

Press the Layout button to switch to the 16 Velocities layout. In this mode, the bottom right 16 pads
represent 16 different velocities for the selected Drum Rack pad. Tap one of the velocity pads to enter
steps at that velocity.

The Pad Grid with the 16 Velocities Layout

Holding the Layout button gives you momentary access to the loop length controls. You can also lock
the loop length controls in place by holding Shift and pressing the Layout button. To unlock the loop
length pads, press the Layout button again.

33.3.3 64-Pad Mode

You can also use the entire 8x8 pad grid for real-time drum playing. This is useful when working with
very large drum kits, such as those created by slicing. To switch to 64-pad mode, press the Layout
button again.

When moving between 64-pad mode and the Loop Selector or 16 Velocities layouts, the 16 pads
available for step sequencing will not change automatically. You may still need to use the touch strip
or Octave keys in order to see the specific 16 pads you want.

Holding the Layout button gives you momentary access to the loop length controls. You can also lock
the loop length controls in place by holding Shift and pressing the Layout button. To unlock the loop
length pads, press the Layout button again.

33.3.4 Loading Individual Drums

Browse Mode can also be used to load or replace individual pads within a loaded Drum Rack. To
switch between browsing Drum Racks and single pads, make sure you’re in Device Mode by pressing
the Device button. This will show the devices on the track.

Device Button.

By default, the Drum Rack is selected. To select an individual pad instead, tap that pad, then press the
second upper display button. The square icon next to the name represents a pad.

Selecting an Individual Pad in a Drum Rack.

Now, entering Browse Mode again will allow you to load or replace the sound of only the selected
pad. The selected pad will flash. Once in Browse Mode, tapping other pads will select them for
browsing, allowing you to quickly load or replace multiple sounds within the loaded Drum Rack.

After loading the selected item, the Load button’s name will change to Load Next. Pressing this button
again will load the next entry in the list, allowing you to quickly try out presets or samples in the
context of your song. You can also load the previous entry in the list via the Load Previous button.

Particularly in a performance situation, you may want to select a pad without triggering it. To do this,
press and hold the Select button while tapping a drum pad or one of the 16 Velocity pads.

Select Button.

You can also select without triggering by pressing the lower display button for the Drum Rack’s track.
This will expand the Drum Rack and allow the individual pads to be selected via the other lower
display buttons. You can navigate to the previous or next pad via the left and right arrow keys.

Press the Drum Rack’s Lower Display Button to Access Individual Pads.

33.3.4.1 Additional Pad Options for Push 2

To copy a pad to a different location in your Drum Rack, hold the Duplicate button and press the pad
you’d like to copy.

Duplicate Button.

While continuing to hold Duplicate, press the pad where you’d like to paste the copied pad. Note that
this will replace the destination pad’s devices (and thus its sound) but will not replace any existing
notes already recorded for that pad.

When a single pad is selected, you can adjust its choke group assignment via the first encoder or
transpose the pad via the second encoder.

Assign a Pad to a Choke Group or Transpose the Pad.

When working with drums, Push 2’s pads can be colored individually. To change a pad’s color, hold
Shift and tap the pad. Then tap one of the pads on the outer ring to choose that color for the selected
pad.

Your custom pad colors will be saved and reloaded with your Live Set, but will not be visible within
Live. They only appear on Push 2.

Choose a Color for a Drum Pad.

33.3.5 Step Sequencing Beats

Tapping a pad selects it and also enables it for step sequencing.

To record notes with the step sequencer, tap the pads in the step sequencer controls to place notes in
the clip where you want them. The clip will begin playing as soon as you tap a step. By default, each
step sequencer pad corresponds to a 16th note, but you can change the step size via the Scene/Grid
buttons.

Scene/Grid Buttons.

Adjust the tempo using the Tempo encoder. Each click of the encoder will adjust the tempo in
increments of one BPM. Holding Shift while adjusting will set the tempo in increments of .1 BPM.

Adjust the Tempo with the Tempo Encoder.

As the clip plays, the currently playing step is indicated by the moving green pad in the step
sequencer section. When Record is enabled, the moving pad will be red. Tapping a step that already
has a note will delete that note. Press and hold the Mute button while tapping a step to deactivate it
without deleting it. Press and hold the Solo button while tapping a pad to solo that sound.

Mute and Solo Buttons.

You can also adjust the velocity and micro-timing of individual notes, as described in the section on
step sequencing automation.

To delete the entire pattern, press the Delete button. To delete all notes for a single pad, press and
hold Delete while tapping that pad. Holding Delete while pressing a pad that has no notes recorded
in the current pattern deletes all of the devices from that pad.

Delete Button.

The pad colors in the step sequencer section indicate the following:

•
•
•
•

Gray — this step doesn’t contain a note.
The clip’s color — this step contains a note. Higher velocities are indicated by brighter pads.
Lighter version of the clip’s color — this step contains a note, but the note is muted.
Unlit — the right two columns of pads will be unlit if triplets are selected as the step size. In this
case, these pads are not active; only the first six pads in each row of steps can be used.

When Triplets are Selected, the Unlit Steps are Unavailable.

For detailed information about adjusting the loop length pads, see the section called Adjusting the
Loop Length.

33.3.6 Real-time Recording

Drum patterns can also be recorded in real-time by playing the Drum Rack pads. Follow these steps to
record in real-time:

•

If you want to record with a click track, press the Metronome button to enable Live’s built-in
click. You can adjust the metronome volume by holding the Shift button while adjusting the
Master volume encoder. As with all of the buttons on Push 2 that turn something on or off, when
the metronome is on, its button light will pulse.

Metronome Button.

•

Then Press the Record button to begin recording.

Record Button.

If you’ve enabled a recording count-in in Live, you’ll see a countdown bar move across the top of
Push 2’s display and flash in tempo. This can serve as a helpful visual reference for when to begin
playing.

Count-In Bar in Push 2’s Display

Now any Drum Rack pads you play will be recorded to the clip. Pressing Record again will stop
recording but will continue playing back the clip. Pressing Record a third time will enable overdub
mode, allowing you to record into the clip while it plays back. Subsequent presses continue to toggle
between playback and overdub. During playback, a small progress bar will appear in the display to
show the playback position of each playing clip.

The pads are velocity sensitive, but if you want to temporarily override the velocity sensitivity, press the
Accent button. When Accent is enabled, all played or step-sequenced notes will be at full velocity
(127), regardless of how hard you actually tap the pads.

Enable Accent to Play or Record at Full Velocity.

If you press and release Accent quickly, the button will stay on. If you press and hold, the button will
turn off when released, allowing for momentary control of accented notes.

In 16 Velocities mode, you can tap one of the 16 velocity pads to record the selected sound at that
velocity. Note that Accent overrides this behavior.

Pressing New stops playback of the currently selected clip and prepares Live to record a new clip on
the currently selected track. This allows you to practice before recording a new idea. By default,
pressing New also duplicates all clips that are playing on other tracks to a new scene and continues
playing them back seamlessly. This behavior can be changed by changing the Workflow mode in
Push 2’s Setup menu.

New Button.

33.3.7 Fixed Length Recording

Press the Fixed Length button to set the size of new clips to a predetermined length.

Fixed Length Button.

Press and hold Fixed Length to set the recording length.

Fixed Length Recording Options.

When Fixed Length is disabled, new clips will continue to record until you press the Record, New or
Play/Stop buttons.

By default, starting a recording with Fixed Length enabled will create an empty clip of the selected
length, and then begin recording from the beginning of the clip, in accordance with Live’s global
launch quantization. If Phrase Sync is enabled, Push 2 treats the chosen length as a musical phrase,
and will begin recording from the position in the clip that corresponds to that position within a phrase
of that length. For example, with a fixed length of 4 bars and Phrase Sync on, starting a recording
when Live’s global transport is at bar 7 will create an empty four bar clip and begin recording at the
third bar of that clip.

Enabling Fixed Length while recording will switch recording off and loop the last few bars of the clip,
depending on the Fixed Length setting.

33.4 Additional Recording Options

33.4.1 Recording with Repeat

With Push 2’s Repeat button enabled, you can hold down a pad to play or record a stream of
continuous, rhythmically-even notes. This is useful for recording steady hi-hat patterns, for example.
Varying your finger pressure on the pad will change the volume of the repeated notes.

Repeat Button.

The repeat rate is set with the Scene/Grid buttons. Note that Push 2 “remembers” the Repeat button’s
state and setting for each track. If you press and release Repeat quickly, the button will stay on. If you
press and hold, the button will turn off when released, allowing for momentary control of repeated
notes.

Turn up the Swing knob to apply swing to the repeated notes. When you touch the knob, the display
will show the amount of swing.

Swing Knob.

33.4.2 Quantizing

Pressing Push 2’s Quantize button will snap notes to the grid in the selected clip.

Quantize Button.

Press and hold Quantize to change the quantization options:

Quantization Options.

Swing Amount determines the amount of swing that will be applied to the quantized notes. Note that
the Swing amount can be adjusted from Encoder 1 or from the dedicated Swing knob.

Quantize To sets the nearest note value to which notes will be quantized, while Quantize Amount
determines the amount that notes can be moved from their original positions.

Enable Record Quantize by pressing the corresponding upper display button to automatically
quantize notes during recording. Adjust the record quantization value with Encoder 5. Note that if
Record Quantize is enabled and Swing is turned up, the automatically quantized notes will not have
swing applied.

When working with drums, press and hold Quantize and press a Drum Rack pad to quantize only that
drum’s notes in the current clip.

33.4.3 Arrangement Recording

When Live’s Arrangement View is in focus in the software, pressing Record will toggle Arrangement
Recording on and off. While Arrangement Recording is on, all of your actions on Push 2 are recorded
into the Arrangement View.

You can also trigger Arrangement Recording while Live’s Session View is in focus by holding Shift and
pressing Record. Note that this behavior is reversed when the Arrangement is in focus; holding Shift
and pressing Record will then toggle Session recording.

33.5 Playing Melodies and Harmonies

After working on a beat, you’ll want to create other elements such as a bassline, harmony parts, etc. If
you already have additional tracks in your Set, you can switch between them using the lower display
buttons or the left and right arrow keys.

Switch Between Tracks with the Lower Display Buttons.

Or you can add a new track by pressing the Add Track button.

Add Track Button.

Adding a track puts Push 2 into Browse mode, allowing you to select which type of track you’d like to
add (MIDI, Audio, or Return) and optionally load a device to the new track at the same time.

Choose a Track Type and Optionally Load A Device.

Note that when pressing the Add Track button while a track within a Group Track is selected, any new
tracks will be inserted into that Group Track.

After creating a track, you can change its color. To do this, hold Shift and press the lower display
button for the track. Then tap one of the pads on the outer ring to choose that color for the selected
track.

When working with a MIDI track containing an instrument, Push 2’s 8x8 pad grid automatically
configures itself to play notes. By default, every note on the grid is in the key of C major. The bottom
left pad plays C1 (although you can change the octave with the Octave Up and Down buttons).
Moving upward, each pad is a fourth higher. Moving to the right, each pad is the next note in the C
major scale.

Play a major scale by playing the first three pads in the first row, then the first three pads in the next
row upwards. Continue until you reach the next C:

C Major Scale.

The pad colors help you to stay oriented as you play:

•
•
•
•

The track’s color — this note is the root note of the key (e.g., C).
White — this note is in the scale, but is not the root.
Green — the currently-playing note (other pads will also turn green if they play the same note).
Red — the currently-playing note when recording.

To play triads, try out the following shape anywhere on the grid:

C Major Chord.

Holding the Layout button gives you momentary access to the loop length controls. You can also lock
the loop length controls in place by holding Shift and pressing the Layout button. To unlock the loop
length pads, press the Layout button again.

33.5.1 Playing in Other Keys

Press Push 2’s Scale button to change the selected key and/or scale.

Scale Button.

Using the upper and lower display buttons, you can change the key played by the pad grid. The
currently selected key appears in white, while the other key options appear in gray:

By default, the pads and scale selection options indicate major scales. You can change to a variety of
other scale types using encoders 2 through 7. The selected scale type is highlighted.

Key, Scale, and Layout Options.

In addition to changing the key, you can also change the arrangement of the grid in a number of
ways:

The Layout (Encoder 1) and Direction (Encoder 8) controls work together to determine the orientation
of the pad grid. The default settings are a Layout of “4ths” and a Direction of “Vert.” In this
configuration, each pad is a 4th higher than the pad directly below it. Changing the Layout to “3rds“
means that each pad is now a 3rd higher than the pad directly below it. The “Sequent” layout puts all
notes sequentially in order. This layout is useful if you need a very large range of notes available,
because it has no duplicated notes.

Changing the Direction control to “Horiz.” rotates the pad grid 90 degrees. For example, with a
Layout of “4ths,” each pad is a 4th higher than the pad to its left.

Fixed Off/On: The lower right display button toggles Fixed on or off. When Fixed is on, the notes on
the pad grid remain in the same positions when you change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play
C, except in keys that don’t contain a C, in which case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in
the key. When Fixed is off, the notes on the pad grid shift so that the bottom-left pad always plays the
root of the selected key.

In Key/Chromatic: The lower left display button toggles between In Key and Chromatic. With In Key
selected, the pad grid is effectively “folded” so that only notes within the key are available. In
Chromatic Mode, the pad grid contains all notes. Notes that are in the key are lit, while notes that are
not in the key are unlit.

Scale options are saved with the Set, and Push 2 will return to these settings when the Set is loaded
again. If you have particular key and scale settings that you like to use all the time, you can save them
in your Default Set. Any new Set created after this will have those settings in place when working with
Push 2.

All of the real-time recording options available for drums are also available for melodies and
harmonies, including the Accent button, fixed length recording, recording with repeat, and quantizing.
But for detailed editing, you’ll work with the Melodic Sequencer described in the next section.

One editing possibility is available in the real-time Note Mode: to quickly delete all notes of the same
pitch within the current loop, press and hold Delete and then tap the respective pad.

33.6 Step Sequencing Melodies and Harmonies

In addition to playing and recording in real time, you can also step sequence your melodies and
harmonies. To toggle to the Melodic Sequencer, press the Layout button. This will set the 8x8 pad grid
as follows:

The Pad Grid When Step Sequencing Pitches.

When using the Melodic Sequencer, all eight rows of pads allow you to place notes in the clip. You
can adjust the loop length and access additional step sequencing pages via the loop length pads. The
loop length pads can be momentarily accessed in the top row while holding the Layout button.

You can also lock the loop length pads in place. To do this, hold Shift and tap the Layout button. Note
that Push remembers this locked/unlocked state for each track. To unlock the loop length pads, press
the Layout button again.

With In Key selected, each row corresponds to one of the available pitches in the currently selected
scale. With Chromatic selected, notes that are in the key are lit, while notes that are not in the key are
unlit. The white row (which is the bottom row by default) indicates the root of the selected key. Each
column of pads represents a step in the resolution set by the Scene/Grid buttons.

As with the real-time playing layout, pressing the Octave Up or Down button shifts the range of
available notes. You can also use the touch strip to change the range. Hold the Shift key while
adjusting the touch strip to shift the range by octaves. Hold the shift key while pressing the Octave
buttons to shift by one note in the scale. The display will briefly show the available range as you adjust
it.

Additionally, brightly-lit touch strip lights indicate the currently available note range, while dimly-lit
touch strip lights indicate that the clip contains notes within the corresponding note range.

Pressing Layout again will toggle to the Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes layout.

In addition to adding and removing notes, you can also adjust the velocity and micro-timing of the
notes, as described in the section on step sequencing automation.

33.6.1 Adjusting the Loop Length

The loop length controls allow you to set the length of the clip’s loop and determine which part of it
you can see and edit in the melodic and drum step sequencers. Each loop length pad corresponds to
a page of steps, and the length of a page depends on the step resolution. When working with drums
at the default 16th note resolution, two pages of steps are available at a time, for a total of two bars.
In the Melodic Sequencer layout, one page of eight steps is available at a time, for a total of two
beats. To change the loop length, hold one pad and then tap another pad, or, to set the loop length to
exactly one page, quickly double-tap the corresponding pad.

Each Loop Length Pad Corresponds to One Page.

Note that the page you see is not necessarily the page you hear. When you set the loop length, the
pages will update so that the current play position (as indicated by the moving green pad in the step
sequencer section) always remains visible. But in some cases, you may want to disable this auto-
follow behavior. For example, you may want to edit a single page of a longer loop, while still
allowing the loop to play for the length you set. To do this, single-tap the pad that corresponds to that
page. This will “lock” the view to that page without changing the loop length. You can also navigate
to the previous or next page by pressing the Page Left/Right buttons.

The Page Left/Right Buttons.

To then turn auto-follow back on, simply reselect the current loop. Note that single-tapping a page
that is outside of the current loop will immediately set the loop to that page. You can also turn auto-
follow back on by holding either one of the Page Left/Right buttons.

The pad colors in the loop length section indicate the following:

•
•
•
•
•

Unlit — this page is outside of the loop.
Gray — this page is within the loop, but is not currently visible in the step sequencer section.
White — this page is visible in the step sequencer section, but is not currently playing.
Green — this is the currently playing page.
Red — this is the currently recording page.

If you need to access the loop length pads frequently, you can lock them in place. To do this, hold
Shift and tap the Layout button. Note that Push remembers this locked/unlocked state for each track.
To unlock the loop length pads, press the Layout button again. You can also navigate to the previous
or next page by pressing the Page Left/Right buttons.

To duplicate the contents of a sequencer page, hold Duplicate, press the loop length pad for the page
you want to duplicate, and then press the loop length pad for the destination page. Note that this will
not remove existing notes in the destination page, but will add copied notes on top. To remove notes
first, hold Delete and tap the loop length pad for that page.

33.7 Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes

The Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes layout combines both step sequencing and real-time playing
capabilities. Providing access to multiple octaves and steps on a single page, this layout is ideal for
figuring out chords and harmonies to sequence. It is also well suited to longer phrases.

The Pad Grid with the Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes Layout.

33.7.1 32 Notes

The bottom half of the pad grid lets you play notes in real-time, and select them for step sequencing.
Each pad corresponds to one of the available pitches in the currently selected scale. Pressing a pad
will select and play the note. Selected notes are represented by a lighter version of the track’s color.

To select a pad without triggering it, press and hold the Select button while tapping a pad.

The pad colors indicate the following:

•
•
•
•

The track’s color — this note is the root note of the scale.
Lighter version of the track’s color — this pad is selected.
Green — this pad is currently playing.
White — this note is in the scale, but is not the root.

Pressing the Octave Up or Down button shifts the range of available notes. Holding the Shift key while
adjusting the touch strip shifts the range by octaves. You can hold the Shift key while pressing the
Octave buttons to shift by one note in the scale. The display will briefly show the available range as
you adjust it.

As with the 64 Notes layout, the notes in the bottom half of the pad grid can be adjusted via the Scale
menu.

33.7.2 Sequencer

Tapping a step in the top half of the pad grid adds all selected notes to that step. Steps containing
notes are lit in the color of the clip.

Holding a step lets you view notes contained within the step, which are indicated in the bottom half of
the pad grid by the lighter version of the track’s color. Tapping any of these selected notes will remove
it from the step.

Holding multiple steps will add selected notes to all those steps. While holding Duplicate, you can
press a step to copy the notes in that step and then press another step to paste them to a new location
in the step sequencer.

The pad colors in the step sequencer indicate the following:

•
•
•
•
•
•

The clip’s color — this step contains a note.
Green — this step is currently playing.
White — this step is selected.
Light gray — this step contains a note, but the note is muted.
Gray — this pad is empty.
Unlit — the right two columns of pads will be unlit if triplets are selected as the step size. In this
case, these pads are not active; only the first six pads in each row of steps can be used.

Loop Length Pads in the Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes Layout.

You can adjust the loop length and access additional step sequencing pages via the loop length
pads. The loop length pads can be momentarily accessed in the fifth row while holding the Layout
button.

The Layout Button.

You can also lock the loop length pads in place. To do this, hold Shift and tap the Layout button. Note
that Push remembers this locked/unlocked state for each track. To unlock the loop length pads, press
the Layout button again. You can also navigate to the previous or next page by pressing the Page
Left/Right buttons.

The Page Left/Right Buttons.

To duplicate the contents of a sequencer page, hold Duplicate, press the loop length pad for the page
you want to duplicate, and then press the loop length pad for the destination page. Note that this will

not remove existing notes in the destination page, but will add copied notes on top. To remove notes
first, hold Delete and tap the loop length pad for that page.

33.8 Working with Samples

Push 2 allows you to play samples from the pads in a variety of ways, with detailed but easy-to-use
control over sample parameters directly from the encoders and display. The instrument that powers
Push 2’s sample playback functionality is Simpler, and we recommend reading the detailed Simpler
chapter to learn more about its functionality.

To start working with a sample, you can either add a new MIDI track or press Browse to enter Browse
Mode on an existing MIDI track. Although you can load an empty Simpler to a track, it isn’t playable
until it contains a sample. Push 2’s display will inform you that your Simpler is empty and suggest
browsing for a sample:

Press Browse to Load a Sample in an Empty Simpler.

After loading a sample and switching to Device View, you will see the sample’s waveform in Push 2’s
display, along with a number of parameters that allow you to quickly adjust how the sample plays
back. This is the main bank of Simpler’s controls.

Simpler’s Main Parameter Bank in the Display.

By default, Simpler will automatically set certain parameters based on the length of the loaded
sample. For example, short samples will play once when triggered, while long samples will be set to
loop and warp. Warped samples will play back at the tempo of your Set, regardless of which note
you play. Bringing a warped clip into Simpler from an audio track, the browser, or your desktop
preserves any warp settings and markers that were in the original clip. For more information about
warping, see the Audio Clips, Tempo, and Warping chapter.

The most important parameter that determines how Simpler will treat samples is the Mode control,
which is used to choose one of Simpler’s three playback modes.

Simpler’s Mode Parameter.

•

•

•

Classic Playback Mode is the default mode when using Simpler, and is optimized for creating
“conventional” melodic and harmonic instruments using pitched samples. It features a complete
ADSR envelope and supports looping, allowing for samples to sustain as long as a note is held
down. Classic Mode is polyphonic by default, and the pad grid uses the same layout in this
mode as is used when playing other pitched instruments.
One-Shot Playback Mode is exclusively for monophonic playback, and is optimized for use
with one-shot drum hits or short sampled phrases. This mode has simplified envelope controls
and does not support looping. By default, the entire sample will play back when a note is
triggered, regardless of how long the note is held. The pad grid in One-Shot Mode also uses
the melodic layout.
Slicing Playback Mode non-destructively slices the sample so that the individual slices can be
played back from the pads. You can create and move slices manually, or choose from a
number of different options for how Simpler will automatically create slices. This mode is ideal
for working with rhythmic drum breaks.

33.8.1 Classic Playback Mode

Simpler’s Main Bank in Classic Mode.

In Classic Mode, the various sample position controls change which portion of the sample you play
back. For example, if you load a drum break that contains silence at the beginning, you can start
playback from after the silence. The Start control sets the absolute position in the sample from which
playback could start, while the End control sets where playback could end; these parameters define
the region of the sample that can be worked with. S Start and S Length are represented in
percentages of the total sample length enabled by Start and End. For example, hitting a pad after
setting an S Start value of 50% and S Length value of 25% will play back the third quarter (50-75%)
of the region between the Start and End values. S Loop Length determines how much of the available
sample (also determined by the Start and End values) will loop. Note that this parameter is only active
if Loop is enabled.

Adjust the Zoom encoder to zoom into a portion of the waveform. The display shows a representation
of the whole sample, as well as the currently active region. Turning the Zoom encoder clockwise
zooms in. The specific portion of the sample that you zoom to is determined by the last-touched
sample position control, e.g., Start, End, S Start, S Length.

Pressing Simpler’s upper display button will enter Edit Mode. When in Edit Mode, the lower display
buttons select additional pages of parameters and the upper display buttons toggle certain settings on
or off. Pressing Simpler’s upper display button again will exit Edit Mode.

Additional Parameters Available in Edit Mode.

Pressing the Loop On/Off button determines whether or not the sample will loop when a pad is held
down. The Warp as… button adjusts the warping of the sample between the Start and End values so
that it will play back precisely within the specified number of bars. Live makes its best guess about
what this value should be based on the length of the sample, but if it gets it wrong, you can use the ÷2
or ×2 buttons to double or halve the playback speed, respectively.

Crop removes the portions of the sample that are outside of the Start and End points, while Reverse
plays the entire sample backwards. Note that both Crop and Reverse are non-destructive; they create
a copy of the sample and apply the process to the copy, so your original sample is not changed.

33.8.2 One-Shot Mode

Simpler’s Main Bank in One-Shot Mode With Additional Edit Mode Controls.

In One-Shot Mode, the Zoom, Start, and End controls function the same as in Classic Mode, as do the
Warp as…, ÷2, ×2, Crop, and Reverse buttons.

With Trigger enabled, the sample will continue playing even after the pad is released; the amount of
time you hold the pad has no effect when Trigger is on. You can shape the volume of the sample using
the Fade In and Fade Out encoders. Fade In determines how long it takes the sample to reach its
maximum volume after a pad is hit, while Fade Out begins a fade out the specified amount of time
before the end of the sample region. To stop a one-shot sample immediately, hold Shift while pressing
the Play/Stop button.

With Gate enabled, the sample will begin fading out as soon as you release the pad. The Fade Out
time determines how long it will take to fade to silence after release.

The Transpose encoder allows you to transpose the sample up or down by up to 48 semitones (four
octaves). Note that when transposing, the timbre of the sample may change dramatically depending
on which Warp Mode you’ve selected. The Gain encoder sets the overall volume of the Simpler
instrument.

33.8.2.1 Legato Playback

Classic and One-Shot Modes provide a unique way of repitching a sample on the fly, without
changing its playback position. This is essentially a playable version of Legato Mode in clips. To
enable this functionality:

1.
2.
3.

In Edit Mode, press the second lower display button to view the Global parameter bank.
Set the Glide Mode parameter to Glide.
Set the Voices parameter to 1. Note that this parameter is only available in Classic Mode. In
One-Shot Mode, playback is always monophonic.

Now, as you play the pads legato, the sample will transpose without changing playback position. For
best results, make sure Warp is on (in the Warp parameter bank). The Complex Pro Warp Mode tends
to sound best when transposing, but experiment with the various Warp Modes to see which one works
best for your particular sample.

33.8.3 Slicing Mode

Simpler’s Main Bank in Slicing Mode With Additional Edit Mode Controls.

In Slicing Mode, the Zoom, Start, and End controls function the same as in Classic and One-Shot
Modes, as do the Warp as…, ÷2, ×2, and Reverse buttons.

The Slice By chooser determines the specific way in which slices will be created:

•

•

•

•

Transient - Slices are placed on the sample’s transients automatically. The Sensitivity encoder
determines how sensitive Simpler is to transient levels within the sample, and thus how many
slices will be automatically created. Higher numbers result in more slices, up to a maximum of
64 slices.
Beat - Slices are placed at musical beat divisions. The Division encoder selects the beat division
at which Simpler will slice the sample region.
Region - Slices are placed at equal time divisions. The Regions encoder selects the number of
evenly-spaced slices that will be created.
Manual - When Manual is selected, no slices are placed automatically. Instead, slices are
created manually by enabling Pad Slicing and tapping empty pads as the sample plays back.
To create manual slices:

1.
2.

3.

4.

Tap a pad that contains a slice to begin playback from that slice.
When the sample reaches the point at which you would like to create an additional slice (a
drum hit, for example), tap any empty pad.
A slice will be placed at this point and it will be assigned to a pad. Any pads that were already
assigned after this point will be shifted “upward” on the pad grid.
Once the loop is sliced as you like it, turn Pad Slicing off.

In all slicing modes, slices are laid out from left to right in groups of four starting from the bottom left
pad. Each additional four slices are placed on the next four pads up. After the left half of the pad grid
is used, slices are placed along the bottom row on the right side of the pad grid, again moving
upwards in groups of four.

Up to 64 Slices Can Be Created.

By default, the pad grid uses the 64-pad drum layout when in Slicing Mode. Pressing the Layout
button cycles between 64-pad, Loop Selector, and 16 Velocities modes.

The Playback encoder determines how many slices can be triggered simultaneously. Mono is
monophonic; only one pad can be played or sequenced at a time. When set to Poly, multiple pads
can be triggered together. When set to Through, playback is monophonic, but triggering one slice will
continue playback through the rest of the sample region.

The Trigger/Gate switch is the same concept as in One-Shot Playback Mode, but what you actually
hear depends on which Playback mode is selected.

Nudge allows you to adjust the position of each slice marker. This is especially useful for fine-tuning
slices that you’ve created in Manual mode. For greater nudging accuracy, tap the pad you’d like to
adjust and use the Zoom encoder to get a closer look. Hold Shift while adjusting Nudge for extremely
small adjustments.

Split Slice creates a new slice in the middle of the currently selected slice. This is also useful in Manual
mode, in conjunction with Nudge, for fine-tuning slices created via Pad Slicing.

To delete a slice (either manually or automatically created), hold Delete and tap the corresponding
pad.

33.9 Navigating in Note Mode

Now that you’ve created a few tracks, you can continue to add more. But you may want to move
between already-existing tracks to continue working on musical ideas using those instruments and
devices. You can move directly to a new track using the lower display buttons or move sequentially to
the previous or next track using the left and right arrow buttons.

Arrow Buttons.

Note that selecting a MIDI track on Push 2 automatically arms it, so it can be played immediately. In
Live, track Arm buttons will appear pink to indicate that they have been armed via selection.

Pink Track Arm Button.

You can also manually arm any track by holding the lower display button for that track, or by holding
the Record button and pressing the track’s lower display button.

This is useful if, for example, you want to use Push 2 to record audio clips. In Live, a manually armed
track’s track Arm button will appear red. On Push 2’s display, manually armed tracks appear with a
special icon.

Icon for a Manually Armed Track.

The specific behavior of the Up/Down Arrows is determined by the Workflow mode, which is set in
Push 2’s Setup menu. In both modes, the Up/Down Arrows move up or down by a single scene. In
Scene Workflow, the selected scene is triggered. In Clip Workflow, only the selected track’s clip is
triggered. Clips in other tracks are not affected.

Navigating with the Up/Down Arrows in Note Mode always begins playback immediately, and a
triggered clip will take over the play position from whatever clip was played in that track before. Note
that this is the same behavior as if the clips were set to Legato Mode in Live.

33.10 Working With Instruments and Effects

Pressing the Device button puts Push 2 in Device Mode, which allows you to use the encoders to
control parameters in Live’s devices and third-party plug-ins.

Device Button.

In Device Mode, the upper display buttons select devices in the currently selected track, enabling their
parameters for editing. The currently selected device is highlighted in the display.

Device Mode Settings.

Once a device is selected, pressing its upper display button again will enter Edit Mode. When in Edit
Mode, the lower display buttons select additional pages of parameters for the selected device.

Device Parameter Pages in Edit Mode.

When in Edit Mode, pressing the leftmost upper display button will take you back up to the Device
Mode’s top level.

Press the Leftmost Upper Display Button to Exit Edit Mode.

Certain devices, such as Live’s Operator instrument, have more than eight pages of parameters. When
working with these devices in Edit Mode, the rightmost lower display button will show an arrow. Press
this button to scroll to the additional pages and then press the leftmost lower display button to get
back.

Scroll to Additional Pages of Parameters.

33.10.1 Adding, Deleting, and Reordering Devices

To load additional devices such as MIDI or audio effects to a track, press the Add Device button. This
will open the Browser and display all device types that can be loaded to the current track.

Add Device Button.

You can also load an instrument via the Add Device button, but be aware that this works just like
Browse Mode: You will replace the instrument that’s already on the track.

As with Browse Mode, use the encoders or arrow keys to navigate between devices in the browser,
and the Load button to load the selected device or preset. Devices will load to the right of the
previously-selected device, although note that MIDI effects will always be placed before the
instrument in the track and audio effects will always be placed after it.

To delete a device, hold the Delete button and press the upper display button that corresponds to the
device.

Deleting a Device.

To disable a device (without deleting it), hold the Mute button and press the upper display button that
corresponds to the device. Disabled devices (and all of their parameters) appear gray in the display.

To re-enable a disabled device, hold Mute and again press the upper display button that corresponds
to the device.

Holding the Mute button for a few moments will lock it on. You can then release Mute and toggle
devices on and off just by pressing the corresponding upper display button. Press Mute again to
unlock it.

To move a MIDI or audio effect to a different position in the track’s chain of devices, press and hold
the upper display button that corresponds to the effect. Then use any of the eight encoders to scroll the
device to the new position and release the upper display button.

33.10.2 Working with Racks

Instrument, Drum, and Effect Racks allow for multiple chains of devices to be contained within a single
device. On Push 2’s display, Racks have special icons that distinguish them from regular devices.

A MIDI Effect Rack, an Instrument Rack, and an Audio Effect Rack.

A Drum Rack.

To open a Rack, select it using the corresponding upper display button. Then press this button again.
The Rack will unfold, revealing the devices in the currently selected chain. An unfolded Rack appears
in the display with an underline that extends to the end of the enclosed devices. Each press of a
selected Rack’s upper display button will toggle it open or closed. Note that Drum Racks cannot be
folded or unfolded directly from Push 2. They will appear in Push 2’s display as folded or unfolded
depending on how they were set within Live.

Expand a Rack to Access Its Devices.

When the Rack itself is selected, the eight encoders control the Rack’s Macro Controls. Once a Rack is
open, you can select one of its contained devices by pressing the relevant upper display button. After
selecting a different device, the encoders will then control its parameters instead.

The Encoders Adjust Parameters for the Selected Device.

To access the devices on additional chains within a multi-chain Rack, press and hold the Rack’s upper
display button. The Rack’s chains will be shown at the bottom of the display and can be selected via
the corresponding lower display buttons.

Selecting a Chain Within a Rack.

33.11 Track Control And Mixing

To control volumes, pans, or sends with the encoders, press the Mix button.

Mix Button.

Each press of the Mix button toggles between Track Mix Mode and Global Mix Mode. In Track Mix
Mode, the first two upper display buttons select between mix parameters for the selected track and
input and output routing options for that track. The lower display buttons are used to select the track.
With Mix selected, the encoders adjust volume, pan, and send levels for the currently selected track.

The Mix Controls in Track Mix Mode.

Hold Shift while adjusting the encoders for fine-tune control.

If your Set contains more than six return tracks, the two rightmost upper display buttons will change to
arrows, which allow you to shift the available parameters left or right.

Scroll to View Additional Sends.

With Input & Output selected, all of the track’s routing and monitoring options can be adjusted from
the encoders.

The Input and Output Settings in Track Mix Mode.

In Global Mix Mode, the encoders adjust either volumes, pans, or send levels for the eight visible
tracks. Select which parameter will be controlled via the upper display buttons.

Controlling the Pans for Eight Tracks.

If your Set contains more than six return tracks, the rightmost upper display button will change to an
arrow, which allows you to shift the available sends to the right. Volumes and Pans will always remain
visible.

If your Set contains more than eight tracks, the left and right arrow keys allow you to shift the visible
tracks left or right.

Press the Master button to select the Main track. Press Master again to return to the previously
selected track.

The Main Track Button.

Note that when Split Stereo Pan Mode is active while in Global Mix Mode, the display will show the
current pan value, but the pan dial will be disabled. In Track Mix Mode, the display will show either
the pan control or stereo pan sliders, depending on the active pan mode.

33.11.1 Rack and Group Track Mixing

On Push 2’s display, Group Tracks and tracks that contain Instrument or Drum Racks have special
icons that distinguish them.

A Group Track and Tracks Containing an Instrument Rack and a Drum Rack.

These types of tracks can be unfolded, allowing you to use the Mix Modes to control the tracks and
chains within them. To unfold one of these tracks, select it using the corresponding lower display
button. Then press this button again. The Group Track or Rack will unfold, revealing the enclosed
tracks or chains. An unfolded track appears in the display with an underline that extends to the end of
the enclosed tracks or chains. Each press of a selected track’s lower display button will toggle it open
or closed.

Expand a Group Track or Track Containing a Rack to Mix its Contents.

Use the left and right arrow keys to access additional chains or tracks that may have been pushed off
the display after unfolding. When working with an unfolded Drum Rack, hold Select and tap a pad to
jump to that pad in the mixer. This can make it easier to mix with a large Drum Rack.

33.12 Recording Automation

Changes that you make to device and mixer parameters can be recorded to your clips as automation,
so that the sound will change over time as the clip plays. To record automation, press Push 2’s
Automation button so that it turns red.

Automation Button.

This toggles Live’s Session Automation Arm button, allowing you to record changes you make to Push
2’s encoders as part of the clip. When you’re done recording parameter changes, press the
Automation button again to turn it off. To delete the changes you’ve recorded for a particular
parameter, press and hold the Delete button and touch the corresponding encoder. If automation
hasn’t been recorded for a parameter, holding Delete and touching an encoder will reset the
corresponding parameter to its default value.

Automated parameters are shown with a white dot next to the parameter in the display. Parameters
that you have overridden (by manually adjusting the parameter while not recording) will show a gray
dot.

Automated and/or Overridden Parameters are Indicated in the Display.

To re-enable all automation that you have manually overridden press and hold Shift and press the
Automation button.

33.13 Step Sequencing Automation

In both the drum and melodic step sequencers, it’s possible to automate parameters for the selected
step.

The parameters that are available will change depending on the display mode you are currently in.

When in Clip Mode, hold one or more steps to access note-specific parameters.

When in Device Mode or Mix Mode, hold one or more steps in order to create and edit device or
mixer automation for only the selected step(s). While holding a step and tweaking an encoder, the
corresponding parameter’s automation value will be adjusted specifically for the time represented by

that step. Note that per-step automation can be created for any step, even if that step doesn’t contain
notes.

33.14 Clip Mode

Press the Clip button to enter Clip Mode, where you can adjust various parameters for the selected
clip.

Clip Button.

When working with an audio track, if no clip is selected, Push will prompt you to load a sample.

Loading a Sample into an Empty Clip Slot in an Audio Track.

The display colors reflect the color of the clip, and the clip’s name is highlighted in the upper-left
corner. Some of the adjustable parameters change depending on the type of clip selected.

In MIDI tracks containing Drum Racks, notes are displayed in their respective pad color. In all MIDI
tracks, the velocity of each note is indicated by its opacity.

Clip Mode With a MIDI Clip Selected.

When a clip is playing on the selected track, the display follows the clip’s song position and scrolls
automatically.

For both MIDI and audio clips, the second upper display button toggles Loop on or off. With Loop on,
you can set the Loop Position, which is where within the clip the loop will begin. Loop Length sets how
many bars and/or beats long the loop is, as measured from the loop position. Start Offset allows you
to begin playback at a different point within the loop, rather than at the loop’s start position. If the
Loop Position and Start Offset are at the same position, moving the Loop Position will result in the Start
Offset moving along with it. With Loop off, you can control the Start and End position. This is the
region that will play (once) when the clip is launched.

Hold Shift while adjusting any of these controls to adjust by 16th-note subdivisions.

You can Zoom in or out of the sample with the first encoder. The position you’ll zoom to is centered
around the last position encoder you touched, e.g., Start, Length, Loop.

Clip Mode With an Audio Clip Selected.

When working with an audio clip, you can also set the clip’s Warp Mode, gain, and transposition.
Hold Shift while adjusting Transpose to adjust in cents rather than in whole semitones. Note that this
also adjusts the Detune parameter in Live’s Clip View.

33.14.1 Using MIDI Tracks in Clip Mode

When working with MIDI tracks in Clip Mode, you can view and refine played or sequenced MIDI
from Push 2.

The display will change depending on the currently selected pad layout.

In addition to the Zoom, Start, End, and Loop controls available in Clip Mode, all pad layouts provide
an additional Crop control, which lets you delete material that falls outside the selected loop.

33.14.2 Real-Time Playing Layouts

When recording your real-time playing using the 64 Notes, 64 Pads or 64 Slices layouts, Clip
Mode’s display lets you see the incoming MIDI notes, and the view adjusts so that all existing notes fit
on the display at the same time. Note that this “folded” display is also shown in Session Mode.

Clip Mode’s Folded Display.

33.14.3 Sequencing Layouts

In the melodic and drum step sequencer layouts, a semi-transparent white box on the display
indicates the sequenceable area. This represents the area on the pads where you can add, delete or
adjust notes.

Clip Mode’s Sequenceable Area.

Each sequenceable area corresponds to one page of steps. A box on the far left side of the display
indicates which pitch range the sequenceable area is in.

As notes are added, lines will appear on the far left side of the display. These lines indicate which
pitch ranges contain notes. You can use these indicator lines to find and edit notes quickly, without
looking at your computer screen.

Pitch ranges with a higher density of notes are represented by thicker lines.

Pitch Range and Note Indicators in Clip Mode.

33.14.3.1 Melodic Sequencer

The Melodic Sequencer layout has a range of eight notes on each page. The sequenceable area can
be moved horizontally via the loop length pads or Page Left/Right buttons, or vertically via the
Octave Up/Down buttons or touch strip.

33.14.3.2 Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes

In this layout, the display will adjust to fit all notes in the clip. When a note(s) that exist in the clip is
selected, their sequenceable area will be highlighted on the display. This makes it quicker to locate
and edit steps containing the selected note(s). The sequenceable area can be moved horizontally via
the Page Left/Right buttons or the loop length pads, which can be accessed momentarily in the fifth
row by holding the Layout button.

Loop Length Pads in the Melodic Sequencer + 32 Notes Layout.

Drums/Slicing Loop Selector and 16 Velocities

The Loop Selector and 16 Velocities layouts show the selected pad only. The sequenceable area can
be moved horizontally via the loop length pads or Page Left/Right buttons, or vertically by selecting a
different pad.

33.14.4 Note-Specific Parameters

When working in any sequencing layout in Clip Mode, you can adjust note settings for each step. To
access these settings, simply press and hold a step. The display will zoom to the page containing that
step, and switch the controls to the step’s note settings. Notes contained within the selected step will
be highlighted.

Hold a Step to Zoom its Page and Access Clip Mode’s Note Parameters.

You can then adjust the corresponding encoders in order to:

•

•
•
•

Nudge notes backwards or forwards in time. The value represents the percentage that the note
is offset from the previous grid line. Negative values indicate that the note occurs before the
grid line.
Adjust the coarse Length of the selected notes.
Fine tune the length adjustment of the selected notes.
Change the Velocity of the selected notes.

You can also adjust these note-specific parameters for multiple steps at the same time. To do this, press
and hold all of the pads you’d like to adjust, and then tweak the encoders. The display will show the
range of values for the selected steps.

You can also create notes with your desired Nudge, Length, and Velocity values by holding an empty
step and then tweaking any of these encoders.

When working with drums, you can adjust nudge, length, and velocity for every note played by a
particular pad by pressing and holding the Select button, pressing the pad, and then adjusting the
encoders.

33.15 Controlling Live’s Session View

Press Push 2’s Session button to switch from Note Mode to Session Mode. You can press and hold the
Session button to temporarily toggle Session Mode. Releasing the button will then return to Note
Mode. Likewise, pressing and holding Note while in Session Mode will temporarily toggle Note
Mode.

Session Button.

In Session Mode, the 8x8 pad grid will now launch clips and the Scene/Grid Buttons will launch
scenes. Pressing a pad triggers the clip in the corresponding location in Live’s Session View. If the track
is selected, pressing the button records a new clip.

The pads light up in different colors so you know what’s going on:

•
•
•

The color of all playing or stopped clips is reflected on the pads.
Playing clips pulse in their color.
Recording clips pulse between red and the clip’s color.

Clip colors can be changed when in Session Mode. To do this, hold Shift and press a pad that
contains a clip. Then tap one of the pads on the outer ring to choose that color for the selected clip.

Pressing the Mute or Solo buttons will mute or solo the currently selected track, respectively. Hold
Mute or Solo and press any track’s lower display button to mute or solo that track. Holding the Mute
or Solo button for a few moments will lock it on. You can then release the button and toggle tracks on
and off just by pressing the corresponding lower display buttons. Press Mute or Solo again to unlock
it.

Pressing the Stop Clip button will stop the playing clip in the currently selected track. Hold Stop Clip
and press any track’s lower display button to stop the playing clip in that track.

Mute, Solo, and Stop Clip Buttons.

Holding the Stop Clip button for a few moments will lock it on. You can then release Stop Clip and
stop clips just by pressing the lower display button for the track you would like to stop. While Stop
Clip is locked on, the lower display buttons will pulse for any tracks that contain a currently playing
clip. Press Stop Clip again to unlock it.

To stop all clips, press and hold Shift, and then press Stop Clip.

Push 2 tells you what’s going on in the software, but, importantly, the software also reflects what’s
happening on the hardware. The clip slots currently being controlled by Push 2’s pad grid are shown
in Live with a colored border.

Hold the Duplicate button and press a clip to copy it. Continue holding Duplicate and tap another clip
slot to paste the clip there.

The arrows and Shift button increase the scope of the eight-by-eight grid.

•

•

Pressing the up or down arrows moves you up or down one scene at a time. Pressing the
Octave Up or Down buttons moves eight scenes up or down.
The left and right arrow keys move you left or right one track at a time. The Page left and right
buttons move eight tracks at a time.

While working in Session Mode when the focus is on Clip Mode, the display is “folded”, which means
all notes within a clip will fit on the display at any given time. Being able to see all notes within a clip
allows you to quickly identify it before launching it. To select a clip without launching it, press and hold
the Select button while tapping the pad containing that clip.

While recording MIDI from an external source (such as a MIDI sequencer or MIDI keyboard), the
folded display lets you see all incoming notes.

When in Session Mode, holding the Layout button gives you momentary access to the Session
Overview, which is explained in more detail below.

33.15.1 Session Overview

Push 2’s Session Overview lets you navigate through large Live Sets quickly without looking at your
computer screen.

Holding the Layout button gives you momentary access to Session Overview, where the pad grid
zooms out to reveal an overview of your Session View. You can also lock the Session Overview in
place by holding Shift and pressing the Layout button. To unlock the Session Overview, press the
Layout button again.

In the Session Overview, each pad represents an eight-scene-by-eight-track block of clips, giving you
a matrix of 64 scenes by 64 tracks. Hit a pad to focus on that section of the Session View. For
example, pressing the pad in row three, column one will put the focus on scenes 17-24 and tracks
1-8. Furthermore, each scene launch button represents a block of 64 scenes (if they are available in
your Set.)

In the Session Overview, the color coding is a little different:

•

•

•

White: indicates the currently selected block of clips, which will be surrounded by the colored
border in the software.
Green: there are clips playing in that block of clips (though that may not be the block of clips
selected).
No color: there are no tracks or scenes in that range.

33.16 Setup Menu

Press the Setup button to adjust brightness, the sensitivity of Push 2’s velocity response, and other
settings.

Setup Button.

Setup Options.

When Pad Sensitivity is turned up, it takes less force to trigger a higher velocity. A Pad Sensitivity of 10
results in higher output levels at any given input velocity, while a setting of 0 results in lower output
levels at the same velocity. The default (and recommended) setting is 5.

Pad Gain boosts or cuts the overall velocity curve. Higher values shift the curve towards the top of the
velocity range, while lower values reduce it. This control has a stronger effect at medium velocities. The
default (and recommended) setting is 5.

Pad Dynamics adjusts the spread of velocities across the output range. At a setting of 10, most
velocities will result in high or low output, without much in the middle. At 0, most velocities will result in
medium output levels (assuming Pad Gain is set to 5). The default (and recommended) setting is 5.

The easiest way to understand the relationship of the three velocity controls is by observing the
changes in the graphical curve below them. The striking force (input) is shown on the horizontal axis,
while the output level is shown on the vertical axis.

To use a linear velocity curve, set Pad Gain to 4 and Pad Dynamics to 7.

Display Light adjusts the brightness of Push 2’s display, while LED Brightness adjusts the brightness of
the pads and buttons. At very low LED Brightness settings, pads may appear to be the wrong color.
The default (and recommended) setting for both controls is 100%.

The Workflow option determines how Push 2 behaves when the Duplicate, New, or Up/Down arrow
buttons are pressed. Which mode you choose depends on how you like to organize your musical
ideas. In Scene Workflow (which is the default), musical ideas are organized and navigated in
scenes. In Clip Workflow, you’re working with only the currently selected clip.

In Scene Workflow:

•

•

•

Duplicate creates a new scene containing all of the currently playing clips, and seamlessly
switches to playing them back. This is the same as the Capture and Insert Scene command in
Live’s Create menu.
New is identical to Duplicate, except that it does not duplicate the currently selected clip.
Instead, an empty clip slot is prepared, allowing you to create a new idea in the current track.
The up and down arrows move up or down by a single scene. Playback of the clips in the new
scene begins seamlessly.

In Clip Workflow:

•

•

•

Duplicate creates a copy of the currently selected clip in the next clip slot, while continuing
playback of any currently playing clips in other tracks. Hold Shift while pressing Duplicate to
create a new scene containing all of the currently playing clips.
New prepares an empty clip slot on the currently selected track. Clips in other tracks are not
affected.
The up and down arrows move up or down by a single scene. Playback of the currently
selected track’s clip in the new scene begins seamlessly. Clips in other tracks are not affected.

33.17 Push 2 Control Reference

The function of each button and control is explained below.

Tap Tempo — As you press once every beat, the tempo of the Live Set will follow your tapping. If the
“Start Playback with Tap Tempo” button is enabled in Live’s Record, Warp & Launch Settings, you can
also use tapping to count in: If you are working in a 4/4 signature, it takes four taps to start song
playback at the tapped tempo. The encoder above the button adjusts Live’s tempo in increments of
one BPM. Holding Shift while adjusting will set the tempo in increments of .1 BPM.

Metronome — Toggles Live’s metronome on or off. The right encoder sets the amount of swing applied
when Quantizing, Record Quantizing or when Repeat is pressed.

Delete — In Note Mode, this button deletes the selected clip. When working with a Drum Rack, hold
Delete and press a pad to delete that pad’s notes in the clip (or the pad itself if there are no recorded
notes). In Session Mode, hold Delete and then press a clip to delete that clip. Hold Delete and select
a device or track with the upper and lower display buttons to delete the device or track. Hold Delete
and touch an encoder to delete automation controlled by that encoder. If automation has not been
recorded for a particular parameter, holding Delete and touching the corresponding encoder will
reset that parameter to its default value. In Simpler’s Slicing Mode, hold Delete and tap a pad to
delete that slice. If the Arrangement View is in focus in Live, pressing Delete will delete the currently
selected clip in the Arrangement.

lower display button to stop the playing clip in that track. While Stop Clip is held down, the lower
display buttons will pulse for any tracks that contain a currently playing clip. Press Stop Clip again to
unlock it. Hold Shift and press Stop Clip to stop all clips.

Convert — Converts the current instrument or clip into a different format. The details of the conversion
depend on what is selected when you press Convert:

•

•

•

•

While working with a Simpler in either Classic or One-Shot Mode, pressing Convert will create
a new MIDI track containing a Drum Rack, with a copy of the Simpler on the first pad. All other
devices that were in the original track will also be copied to the new track.
While working with a Simpler in Slicing Mode, pressing Convert will replace the Simpler on the
same track with a Drum Rack that contains all of the slices mapped to individual pads.
While working with a Drum Rack, pressing Convert will create a new MIDI track containing all
of the devices that were on the selected pad.
While working with an audio clip, pressing Convert allows you to choose between:

◦

◦

Creating a new MIDI track containing a Simpler or a new MIDI track containing a Drum
Rack, with the sample loaded to a Simpler on the first pad. Warp Markers and related
settings will be preserved in the new Simpler, as will all other devices that were in the
original track.
Converting a Harmony, Melody, or Drums to a new MIDI track.

Double Loop — Doubles the material within the loop, as well as the length of the loop.

Quantize — Press and release to quantize the selected notes (or all notes in the clip if there is no
selection). Hold Quantize and press a drum pad to quantize that pad’s notes. For audio clips,
Quantize will affect transients. Press and hold Quantize to access quantization settings. After
changing these settings, press once to exit and then press and release to apply your changes.

Duplicate — In Scene Workflow, Duplicate creates a new scene containing all of the currently playing
clips. In Clip Workflow, Duplicate creates a copy of the currently selected clip in the next clip slot,
while continuing playback of any currently playing clips in other tracks. Hold Duplicate while pressing
a Drum Rack pad to copy the pad and paste it to a new location in the Drum Rack. Hold Duplicate
while pressing a track selection button to duplicate that track. In Session Mode, hold Duplicate and
press a clip to copy it. Continue holding Duplicate and tap another clip slot to paste the clip there.

New — Pressing New stops the selected clip and prepares Live to record new material. This allows
you to practice before making a new recording.

Fixed Length — When enabled, all newly created clips will be a fixed number of bars. When
disabled, new clips will continue to record until you press the Record, New or Play/Stop buttons.
Press and hold, then use the lower display buttons to specify the fixed recording length. Enabling
Fixed Length while recording will switch recording off and loop the last few bars of the clip,
depending on the Fixed Length setting.

Automate — Toggles Live’s Automation Record button. When on, your parameter changes will be
recorded into playing Session View clips. Hold Shift and press Automate to re-enable any automation
that you have overridden. Hold Delete and press the Automation button to delete all automation in a
clip.

Record — With the Session View focused in Live, press the Record button to begin recording a Session
clip. Pressing Record again will stop recording but will continue playing back the clip. Pressing Record
a third time will enable overdub mode, allowing you to record into the clip while it plays back. Hold
Record and press the lower display button for a track to manually arm it. With the Arrangement View
focused in Live, pressing Record will toggle Arrangement Recording on and off. You can also trigger
Arrangement Recording while Live’s Session View is in focus by holding Shift and pressing Record.
Note that this behavior is reversed when the Arrangement is in focus; holding Shift and pressing
Record will then toggle Session recording.

Play/Stop — Toggles the play button in Live’s transport bar. While already stopped, hold Shift and
press Play/Stop to return Live’s transport to 1.1.1 without starting playback.

Touch Strip — When an instrument track is selected, the touch strip adjusts pitch bend or modulation
wheel amount when playing in real-time, or the available range of notes when step sequencing. Pitch
bend is selected by default when an instrument track is selected. To change the functionality of the
touch strip, hold Select and tap the strip. This toggles between pitch bend and mod wheel functionality
each time you tap it. The display will briefly show the current mode each time you change it. Note that
pitch bend and modulation wheel functionality is only available when playing instruments in real time,
and not when using the Melodic Sequencer. When a Drum Rack track is selected, the touch strip
selects the Drum Rack bank.

Encoders and display buttons — The encoders and the two banks of eight buttons above and below
the display change function depending on a variety of factors, including the selected track type, the
current mode, etc. In all modes, the far-right encoder controls the volume of the Main track or the Pre-
Cue volume if Shift is held. Holding Shift while adjusting any of the encoders allows you to fine-tune
whichever parameter is currently being controlled by that encoder.

Add Device — Opens Browse Mode to add a new device to the currently selected track. Devices will
load to the right of the previously-selected device, although note that MIDI effects will always be
placed before the instrument in the track and audio effects will always be placed after it.

Add Track — Puts Push 2 into Browse Mode, allowing you to select which type of track you’d like to
add (MIDI, Audio, or Return) and optionally load a device to the new track at the same time. If the
Add Track button is pressed while a track within a Group Track is selected, any new tracks will be
inserted into that Group Track.

Master — Press the Master button to select the Main track. Press Master again to return to the
previously selected track.

Scene/Grid buttons — These buttons change their functionality depending on whether Session Mode
or Note Mode is selected. When Session Mode is selected, these buttons launch Session View scenes.
Hold the Select button while pressing a Scene button to select the scene without launching it. When
Note Mode is selected, the Scene/Grid buttons determine the rhythmic resolution of the step
sequencer grid and the rhythmic resolution of repeated notes when Repeat is enabled.

Setup — Press to adjust brightness, the sensitivity of Push 2’s velocity response, and other settings.

User — All of Push 2’s built-in functionality can be disabled via User Mode. This allows Push 2 to be
reprogrammed to control alternate functions in Live or other software. Push 2’s relative encoders work
best in “Relative (2’s Comp.)” mode. To ensure this mode is selected, turn the encoder slowly to the left
during mapping.

Device — Press to enter Device Mode, which allows you to use the encoders and upper display
buttons to control parameters in Live’s devices and third-party plug-ins. While in another mode, press
and hold to temporarily toggle to Device Mode. Releasing the button will then return to the previous

time) are played at full velocity. Press and hold Accent to temporarily enable it.

Scale — When Note Mode is on and an instrument track is selected, pressing this button allows you to
select which scale will be played on the pads. Note that this button has no effect when a Drum Rack
track is selected or when in Session Mode.

•

•

•

Fixed On/Off: When Fixed Mode is on, the notes on the pad grid remain in the same positions
when you change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play C, except in keys that don’t
contain a C, in which case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in the key. When Fixed
is off, the notes on the pad grid shift so that the bottom-left pad always plays the root of the
selected key.
In Key/Chromatic: With In Key selected, the pad grid is effectively “folded” so that only notes
within the key are available. In Chromatic Mode, the pad grid contains all notes. Notes that are
in the key are lit, while notes that are not in the key are unlit.
Scale selection: Using the upper and lower display buttons, you can change the key played by
the pad grid. You can change to a variety of scale types using encoders 2 through 7.

Layout — Press to change the layout of the pad grid. When in Session Mode, Layout toggles the
Session Overview on or off. When in Note Mode, the layout options depend on the type of track that
is currently selected and the current mode.

Simpler in Slicing Mode. Pressing Layout toggles between real-time playing and step
sequencing.
MIDI track containing a Drum Rack — With the Loop Selector layout selected, the pad grid is
divided; the lower-left 16 pads play the Drum Rack, the lower-right 16 pads adjust the loop
length of the clip, and the upper four rows control the step sequencer. Press Layout to switch to
16 Velocities layout. Here, the bottom right 16 pads represent 16 different velocities for the
selected Drum Rack pad. Press Layout again to switch to the 64-pad layout, allowing you to
play drums across the entire 8x8 pad grid.

Session — Press to enter Session Mode. When enabled, the pad grid changes to launch clips in Live’s
Session View. While in Note Mode, press and hold Session to temporarily toggle to Session Mode.
Releasing the button will then return to Note Mode.

Octave Up/Down — If an instrument track is selected, these buttons shift the pads up or down by
octave. If a Drum Rack is selected, these buttons shift the Drum Rack’s pad overview up or down by
16 pads. In Session Mode, these buttons shift control of the Session View up or down by eight scenes.
These buttons will be unlit if no additional octaves are available.

Page Left/Right — When working with the drum or melodic step sequencers, these buttons navigate to
the previous or next page of steps. In Session Mode, these buttons shift control of the Session View left
or right by eight tracks.

Shift — Press and hold Shift while pressing other buttons to access additional functionality. Hold Shift
while turning encoders for finer resolution.

Select — In Session Mode, hold Select and press a clip to select the clip without launching it. This will
also display the clip name in the display. In Note Mode, hold Select and press a Drum Rack pad to
select it without triggering the pad.

33.17.0.1 Using Footswitches with Push 2

Two ports on the back of Push 2 allow you to connect momentary footswitches. Footswitch 1 acts as a
sustain pedal. Footswitch 2 gives you hands-free control of Push 2’s recording functionality. A single
tap of the footswitch will toggle the Record button, thus switching between recording/overdubbing
and playback of the current clip. Quickly double-tapping the footswitch is the same as pressing the
New button.

Note that certain footswitches may behave “backwards”; for example, notes may sustain only when
the pedal is not depressed. Footswitch polarity can usually be corrected by connecting the footswitch
to the port while depressing it, but we recommend using footswitches with a physical polarity switch.

34. Synchronizing with Link, Tempo
Follower, and MIDI

34.1 Synchronizing via Link

Ableton Link is a technology that keeps devices in time over a wired or wireless network. Link is built
into Live as well as a growing number of iOS applications, and any Link-enabled software can play in
time with any other Link-enabled software simply by joining the same network.

When using Link, you can start and stop playback of each device or application independently of
every other connected device or application. Link-enabled software will remain in tempo as well as at
the correct position in relation to the global launch quantization of all participants.

34.1.1 Setting up Link

To configure Live to use Link, first make sure that your computer is connected to the same network as
any other devices that you will use Link with. This can either be a local network or an ad-hoc
(computer-to-computer) connection. Then open Live’s Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings and enable the
button next to “Show Link Toggle.”

Showing the Link Toggle in Live’s Settings.

It is possible to sync start and stop commands across all connected apps that have Start Stop Sync
enabled. To do this, click the button next to “Start Stop Sync”.

34.1.2 Using Link

The Link toggle in Live’s Control Bar will appear. Click to toggle Link on or off.

When on, the toggle will update to show the number of other Link-enabled apps or instances of Live
that are on the same network.

Link Indicator Showing Another Connection.

If at least one other Link-enabled app or instance of Live is connected, the Arrangement Position
display will show a moving “progress bar” whenever Live’s transport is not running. This bar is a
representation of the Live Set’s global launch quantization in relation to that of the other participants in
the Link session. After you trigger playback, Live will wait until this bar is filled before starting.

Arrangement Position Shows Relation to Link Timeline.

The first app or Live instance to join a Link session will set the initial tempo for the others. Any Link-
enabled apps or instances of Live can then change their tempo at any time and all others will follow. If
multiple participants try to change the tempo simultaneously, everyone else will try to follow, but the
last one who changes the tempo will “win.”

Tempo changes made by any participant in a Link session will override tempo automation in your Live
Set.

Note that the metronome’s recording count-in cannot be used when Link is enabled.

In most cases, Link will work without issues as soon as it is enabled and will provide reliable
synchronization under all conditions. If you have further questions or run into issues, we recommend
checking out the Link FAQ in the Knowledge Base.

34.2 Synchronizing via Tempo Follower

You might encounter situations where a Link connection or MIDI Clock are not available. Or,
sometimes you might prefer not to use a rigid, computer-generated clock. For example, you might like
Live’s tempo to follow the natural push and pull of a drummer in your band, or you might be trying to
synchronize to a set of turntables during a DJ performance. This is where Tempo Follower comes in.
Tempo Follower analyzes an incoming audio signal in real-time and interprets its tempo, allowing Live
to follow along and keep in time.

34.2.1 Setting Up Tempo Follower

To set an external audio input as a source for Tempo Follower, first open Live’s Link, Tempo & MIDI
Settings. In the Tempo Follower section, set the Input Channel (Ext. In) to the input on your audio
interface that is connected to the source you wish to follow. For a drum kit, this might be a dedicated
overhead microphone. For turntables, you might choose to use a record output or effects loop from a
DJ mixer. Note that while Tempo Follower’s algorithm is optimized for use with audio signals that have
a clear rhythm, you can also be creative and experiment with different sources.

Tempo Follower Settings in Live’s Settings.

When the “Show Tempo Follower Toggle” switch is set to “Show”, you will see a “Follow” button
appear in the Control Bar, alongside the other tempo-related parameters, at the left-hand side.

The Follow Button in the Control Bar.

Activating the “Follow” button will turn on Tempo Follower, and Live will begin listening to the
configured audio source and interpreting its tempo. Note that Tempo Follower does not run when the
Follow button is hidden.

When Tempo Follower cannot be connected to the audio input device channel specified in the
Settings, the feature is disabled and the Follow button will appear grayed out.

Note: Link, Tempo Follower, and External Sync are mutually exclusive; the Link and the External Sync
switches are disabled when Tempo Follower is enabled. Live can still send MIDI clock information to
external devices when Tempo Follower is enabled, but it cannot receive it.

34.3 Synchronizing via MIDI

If you’re working with devices that don’t support Link, you can synchronize via MIDI. The MIDI
protocol defines two ways to synchronize sequencers, both of which are supported by Live. Both
protocols work with the notion of a sync host, which delivers a sync signal that is tracked by the sync
device(s).

MIDI Clock: MIDI Clock works like a metronome ticking at a fast rate. The rate of the incoming ticks is
tempo-dependent: Changing the tempo at the sync host (e.g., a drum machine) will cause the device
to follow the change. The MIDI Clock protocol also provides messages that indicate the song position.
With respect to MIDI Clock, Live can act as both a MIDI sync host and device.

MIDI Timecode: MIDI Timecode is the MIDI version of the SMPTE protocol, the standard means of
synchronizing tape machines and computers in the audio and film industry. A MIDI Timecode
message specifies a time in seconds and frames (subdivisions of a second). Live will interpret a
Timecode message as a position in the Arrangement. Timecode messages carry no meter-related
information; when slaving Live to another sequencer using MIDI Timecode, you will have to adjust the
tempo manually. Tempo changes cannot be tracked. Detailed MIDI Timecode Settings are explained
later in this chapter. With respect to MIDI Timecode, Live can only act as a MIDI sync device, not a
host.

34.3.1 Synchronizing External MIDI Devices to Live

Live can send MIDI Clock messages to an external MIDI sequencer (or drum machine). After
connecting the sequencer to Live and setting it up to receive MIDI sync, turn the device on as a sync
destination in Live’s Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings.

Choosing a MIDI Device for Live.

The lower indicator LED next to the Control Bar’s EXT button will flash when Live is sending sync
messages to external sequencers.

34.3.2 Synchronizing Live to External MIDI Devices

Live can be synchronized via MIDI to an external sequencer. After connecting the sequencer to Live
and setting it up to send sync, use Live’s Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings to tell Live about the connection.

Setting up Live as a MIDI Device.

When an external sync source has been enabled, the EXT button appears in the Control Bar. You can
then activate external sync either by switching on this button or by using the External Sync command
in the Options menu. The upper indicator LED next to the EXT button will flash if Live receives useable
sync messages.

The External Sync Switch.

When Live is synced to an external MIDI device, it can accept song position pointers from this device,
syncing it not only in terms of tempo but in terms of its position in the song. If the host jumps to a new
position within the song, Live will do the same. However, if the Control Bar’s Loop switch is activated,
playback will be looped, and song position pointers will simply be “wrapped“ into the length of the
loop.

When Link is enabled, Live can send MIDI clock information to external devices, but cannot receive it;
the External Sync switch is disabled when Link is enabled.

34.3.2.1 MIDI Timecode Options

Timecode options can be set up per MIDI device. Select a MIDI device from the Link, Tempo & MIDI
Settings’ MIDI Ports list to access the settings.

The MIDI Timecode Frame Rate setting is relevant only if “MIDI Timecode“ is chosen from the MIDI
Sync Type menu. The MIDI Timecode Rate chooser selects the type of Timecode to which Live will
synchronize. All of the usual SMPTE frame rates are available. When the Rate is set to “SMPTE All,“
Live will auto-detect the Timecode format of incoming sync messages and interpret the messages
accordingly. Note that you can adjust the Timecode format that is used for display in the Arrangement
View: Go to the Options menu, and then access the Time Ruler Format sub-menu.

The MIDI Timecode Offset setting is also only relevant if “MIDI Timecode“ is chosen from the Sync
Type menu. You can specify a SMPTE time offset using this control. Live will interpret this value as the
Arrangement’s start time.

34.3.3 Sync Delay

The Sync Delay controls, which are separately available for each MIDI device, allow you to delay
Live’s internal time base against the sync signal. This can be useful in compensating for delays incurred
by the signal transmission. The Sync Delay for a specific MIDI device appears as you select the MIDI
device from the Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings’ MIDI Ports list. To adjust the delay, have both Live and
the other sequencer play a rhythmical pattern with pronounced percussive sounds. While listening to
the output from both, adjust the Sync Delay control until both sounds are in perfect sync.

Adjusting Sync Delay.

35. Computer Audio Resources and
Strategies

Real-time audio processing can be a demanding task for general-purpose computers, which are
usually designed to run spreadsheets and surf the Internet. An application like Live requires a powerful
CPU and a fast SSD. This chapter will provide some insight on how you can avoid and solve computer
resource issues when using Live.

35.1 Managing the CPU Load

To output a continuous stream of sound through the audio hardware, Live has to perform a huge
number of calculations every second. If the processor can’t keep up with what needs to be calculated,
the audio will have gaps or clicks.

Factors that affect computational speed include processor clock rates (e.g., speed in MHz or GHz),
architecture, temperature (in hot environments, modern CPUs will “thermal throttle” and slow down the
CPU processing rate), memory cache performance (how efficiently a processor can grab data from
memory), and system bus bandwidth — the computer’s “pipeline“ through which all data must pass.

Fortunately, Live supports multicore and multiprocessor systems, allowing the processing load from
things like instruments, effects, and I/O to be distributed among the available resources. Depending
on the machine and the Live Set, the available processing power can be several times that of older
systems.

35.1.1 The CPU Load Meter

The Control Bar’s CPU meter displays how much of the computer’s computational potential is currently
being used. For example, if the displayed percentage is 10 percent, the computer is just coasting
along. If the percentage is 100 percent, the processing is being maxed out — it’s likely that you will
hear gaps, clicks or other audio problems.

Note that the CPU meter takes into account only the load from processing audio, not other tasks the
computer performs (e.g., managing Live’s user interface).

The CPU Load Meter.

The CPU meter can display the Average or Current CPU usage, or it can be switched off entirely.

The Average CPU meter displays the average percentage of the CPU currently processing audio,
rather than the overall CPU load. The Current CPU meter displays the total current CPU usage.

You can click on the CPU meter to display the various options.

The CPU Load Meter Options.

By default, Live will not display the Current level; it must be enabled from the drop-down menu.

In new installations of Live 11, the CPU Overload Indicator will also be switched off by default. This
option can be re-enabled from the drop-down menu as needed by selecting Warn on Current CPU
Overload.

To determine the CPU load, Live calculates the time it needs to process one audio buffer. This value is
then compared to the time it takes to actually play one audio buffer.

For example, a value of 50% on the CPU meter means that Live is processing one audio buffer twice
as fast as it takes to play the buffer.

Values over 100% are possible when the calculation takes more time than it does to play one audio
buffer.

Live expects that the audio thread will have the highest priority, however the final prioritization of
threads is done by the operating system, meaning Live’s processing might get interrupted. This is why
other applications may cause CPU spikes in Live’s CPU meter.

35.1.2 CPU Load from Multichannel Audio

One source of constant CPU drain is the process of moving data to and from the audio hardware. This
drain can be minimized by disabling any inputs and outputs that are not required in a project. There
are two buttons in the Audio Settings to access the Input and Output Configuration dialogs, which
allow activating or deactivating individual ins and outs.

Live does not automatically disable unused channels, because the audio hardware drivers usually
produce an audible “hiccup“ when there is a request for an audio configuration change.

35.1.3 CPU Load from Tracks and Devices

Generally, every track and device being used in Live incurs some amount of CPU load. However, Live
is “smart“ and avoids wasting CPU cycles on tracks and devices that do not contribute anything
useful.

For example, dragging devices into a Live Set that is not running does not significantly increase the
CPU load. The load increases only as you start playing clips or feed audio into the effects. When there
is no incoming audio, the effects are deactivated until they are needed again. If the effect produces a
“tail,“ like reverbs and delays, deactivation occurs only after all calculations are complete.

While this scheme is very effective at reducing the average CPU load of a Live Set, it cannot reduce
the peak load. To make sure your Live Set plays back continuously, even under the most intense
conditions, play back a clip in every track simultaneously, with all devices enabled.

In the Session View, it is possible to see each track’s impact on the CPU load by clicking on the Show/
Hide Performance Impact selector in the Mixer Section.

The Show/Hide Performance Impact selector.

In the Performance Impact section, each track has its own CPU meter with six rectangles that light up
to indicate the relative impact of that track on the CPU level of the current Set. Freezing the track with
the largest impact or removing devices from that track will usually reduce the CPU load.

The Session View’s Performance Impact Section.

35.1.4 Track Freeze

Live‘s Freeze Track command can greatly help in managing the CPU load incurred by devices and
clip settings. When you select a track and execute the Freeze Track command, Live will create a
sample file for each Session clip in the track, plus one for the Arrangement. Thereafter, clips in the
track will simply play back their “freeze files“ rather than repeatedly calculating processor-intensive
device and clip settings in real time. The Freeze Track command is available from Live‘s Edit menu and
from the context menu of tracks and clips. Be aware that it is not possible to freeze a Group Track; you
can only freeze tracks that hold clips.

Normally, freezing happens very quickly. But if you freeze a track that contains an External Audio
Effect or External Instrument that routes to a hardware effects device or synthesizer, the freezing
process happens in real-time. Live will automatically detect if real-time freezing is necessary, and
you‘ll be presented with several options for managing the process. Please see the section on real-time
rendering for an explanation of these options.

Once any processing demands have been addressed (or you have upgraded your machine!), you
can always select a frozen track and choose Unfreeze Track from the Edit menu to change device or
clip settings. On slower machines, you can unfreeze processor-intensive tracks one at a time to make
edits, freezing them again when you are done.

Many editing functions remain available to tracks that are frozen. Launching clips can still be done
freely, and mixer controls such as volume, pan, and the sends are still available. Other possibilities
include:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Edit, cut, copy, paste, duplicate, and trim clips.
Draw and edit mixer automation and mixer clip envelopes.
Consolidate clips.
Record Session View clip launches into the Arrangement View.
Create, move, and duplicate Session View scenes.
Drag frozen MIDI clips into audio tracks.

When performing edits on frozen tracks that contain time-based effects such as reverb, you should
note that the audible result may be different once the track is again unfrozen, depending on the
situation. This is because, if a track is frozen, the applied effects are not being calculated at all, and
therefore cannot change their response to reflect edited input material. When the track is again
unfrozen, all effects will be recalculated in real time.

A Frozen Arrangement Track with a Reverb Tail.

Frozen Arrangement View tracks will play back any relevant material extending beyond the lengths of
their clips (e.g., the “tails“ of Reverb effects). These frozen tails will appear in the Arrangement as
crosshatched regions located adjacent to their corresponding clips. They are treated by Live as
separate, “temporary“ clips that disappear when unfrozen, since the effect is then calculated in real
time. Therefore, when moving a frozen clip in the Arrangement, you will usually want to select the
second, frozen tail clip as well, so that the two remain together.

For frozen Session clips, only two loop cycles are included in the frozen clip, which means that clips
with unlinked clip envelopes may play back differently after two loop cycles when frozen.

Dragging a frozen clip to the drop area in the Session View or Arrangement View will create a new
frozen track containing that clip. If a clip is partially selected in the Arrangement, the new frozen track
will contain the selected portion of the clip only.

The samples generated by the Freeze Track command are stored in the Current Project folder under /
Samples/Processed/Freeze. If the Set has not yet been saved, the folder location will be specified by
the Temporary Folder. Please note that freeze files for tracks that contain an External Instrument or
External Audio Effect will be discarded immediately when unfreezing.

You can also decide to flatten frozen tracks, which completely replaces the original clips and devices
with their audible result. The Flatten command is available from the Edit menu.

Besides providing an opportunity to conserve CPU resources on tracks containing a large number of
devices, the Track Freeze command simplifies sharing projects between computers. Computers that
are a bit low on processing power can be used to run large Live Sets as long as any CPU-intensive
tracks are frozen. This also means that computers lacking certain devices used in one Live Set can still
play the Set when the relevant device tracks are frozen.

35.2 Managing the Disk Load

An SSD’s read/write speed can affect Live’s performance. The amount of disk traffic Live generates is
roughly proportional to the number of audio channels being read or written simultaneously. For
example, a track playing a stereo sample causes more disk traffic than a track playing a mono
sample.

The Disk Overload Indicator.

The Disk Overload indicator flashes when the disk was unable to read or write audio quickly enough.
When recording audio, this condition causes a gap in the recorded sample; when playing back, you
will hear dropouts.

Do the following to avoid disk overload:

•

•
•

Reduce the number of audio channels being written by choosing mono inputs instead of stereo
inputs in the Audio Settings’ Channel Configuration dialog.
Use RAM Mode for selected clips.
Reduce the number of audio channels playing by using mono samples instead of stereo
samples when possible. You can convert stereo samples to mono using any standard digital
audio editing program, which can be called up from within Live.

36. Audio Fact Sheet

Much of Ableton‘s development effort has been focused on carefully and objectively testing Live‘s
fundamental audio performance. As a result of this testing, we have regularly implemented a number
of low-level improvements to the audio engine. We have written this fact sheet to help users
understand exactly how their audio is (or is not) being modified when using certain features in Live
that are often misunderstood, as well as tips for achieving the highest quality results.

The focus of our research has been on objective (that is, quantifiable and measurable) behavior. We
make no claims about what you can hear because we cannot possibly predict the variables that make
up your listening environment, audio hardware, hearing sensitivity, etc. Furthermore, this research
makes no claims about how Live compares to other audio software. Rather, it is a summary of
measurable facts about what Live actually does under various conditions.

36.1 Testing and Methodology

As of this writing, every version of Live is subjected to a number of automated tests that cover every
aspect of Live‘s functionality. We add additional tests as we add features, and we will never release
an update unless it passes every test.

36.2 Neutral Operations

Procedures in Live that will cause absolutely no change in audio quality are referred to as neutral
operations. You can be sure that using these functions will never cause any signal degradation.
Applying neutral operations to audio that was recorded into Live ensures that the audio will be
unchanged from the point of analog-to-digital conversion. Applying neutral operations to files
imported into Live ensures that the imported audio will be identical to the files saved on disk. Applying
neutral operations to files being exported from Live ensures that the quality of your output file will be
at least as high as what you heard during playback.

The list of neutral operations found below is provided primarily as an abstract reference; while all of
these operations are, in fact, neutral, it is important to remember that each of them may (and almost
certainly will) occur within a context that also contains non-neutral operations. For example, running
an audio signal through an effects device is a non-neutral operation. So any neutral operations that

occur after it will, of course, still result in audio that is altered in some way. Even a gain change is,
technically, non-neutral.

Neutral operations include:

36.2.1 Undithered Rendering

The Export Audio/Video command renders Live’s audio output to a file on disk. Rendering is a neutral
operation under certain conditions:

•

•

The sample rate of the rendered file is the same as that set for the audio hardware in Live‘s
Settings.
No non-neutral operations have been applied.

Live‘s rendering performance is tested by loading three types of unprocessed audio files (white noise,
fixed-frequency sine waves and sine sweeps) in 16-, 24- and 32-bit word lengths and rendering
these to output files, also with varying bit resolutions. Phase cancellation testing of the original and
output files shows the following:

•

•

•

Rendering to a file with the same bit depth as the original results in complete phase
cancellation.
Rendering to a file with a higher bit depth than the original results in complete phase
cancellation.
Rendering to a file with a lower bit depth than the original results in the smallest amount of
distortion possible within a 32-bit system.

36.2.2 Matching sample rate/no transposition

Playback of an unstretched audio file in Live is a neutral operation, provided that the file‘s sample rate
is the same as that set in Live‘s Settings and that the file is played back without transposition. This is
verified by cancellation tests of rendered output. Please note that “playback“ in this context refers only
to the audio within Live, prior to the point at which it reaches your audio hardware.

36.2.3 Unstretched Beats/Tones/Texture/Re-Pitch Warping

If the tempo of a clip is the same as the tempo of the Set, that clip will play back unstretched. In this
case, if the Warp mode of the clip is set to Beats, Tones, Texture, or Re-Pitch (but not Complex or
Complex Pro), playback will be neutral.

Any Warping caused by changing the Set’s tempo is non-permanent, and audio that plays back
unwarped at a given tempo will always play back unwarped at that tempo, even if the tempo is
changed and then changed back. For example, if you’ve recorded some tracks at 120 BPM, but then
decide you’d like to slow the tempo down to record a particularly difficult solo passage, the original

tracks will play back neutrally again after returning the tempo to 120 BPM. Only the recording made
at the slower tempo will be stretched.

Recording tempo automation in the Arrangement can play back neutrally or not depending on the
Warp Mode. When using Beats mode with transient preservation on, artifacts may occur. These can
be eliminated by preserving 16ths instead of transients, or by using the Repitch Warp Mode.

Please note that grooves work by modifying the positions of Warp Markers. This means that playback
of audio clips with groove applied will be non-neutral even at the original tempo.

The neutrality of unstretched clip playback is verified by performing cancellation tests on rendered
output.

36.2.4 Summing at Single Mix Points

Live uses double precision (64-bit) summing at all points where signals are mixed, including clip and
return track inputs, the Main track and Racks. Mixing in Live is thus a neutral operation for signals
mixed at any single summing point. This is tested by loading pairs of 24-bit files (white noise and
fixed-frequency sine waves and their phase-inverted complements), adding the pairs together eight
times and rendering the output as 32-bit files. All tests result in perfect phase cancellation.

Please note that, while 64-bit summing is applied to each single mix point, Live‘s internal processing is
still done at 32-bit. Thus, signals that are mixed across multiple summing points may still result in an
extremely small amount of signal degradation. This combination of 64-bit summing within a 32-bit
architecture strikes an ideal balance between audio quality and CPU/memory consumption.

36.2.5 Recording external signals (bit depth >/= A/D converter)

Recording audio signals into Live is a neutral operation, provided that the bit depth set in Live‘s
Settings window is the same or higher than that of the A/D converters used for the recording. In this
context, “neutral“ means “identical to the audio as it was delivered to Live by the A/D converters.“

36.2.6 Recording internal sources at 32 bit

Audio that is recorded via internal routing will be identical to the source audio, provided that the
recording was made at 32 bits. To ensure neutral recordings of plug-in instruments and any audio
signals that are being processed by effects plug-ins, internal recording at 32 bits is recommended.
Please note, however, that if the source audio is already at a lower bit depth, internal recording at that
bit depth will also be neutral (assuming that no effects are used); internally recording an unprocessed
16 bit audio file at 32 bits will not increase the sound quality.

The neutrality of internal recording is verified using cancellation tests.

36.2.7 Freeze, Flatten

When tracks are frozen, the audio files that are created are 32 bit, which ensures that they will not be
lower quality than the audio heard prior to freezing. But there are some special cases involving Freeze
that result in non-neutral behavior and should be noted:

Frozen Arrangement View tracks can include audio material that extends beyond the end of the clip
itself, such as reverb tails and delay repetitions. Frozen Session View tracks, however, are always
exactly two loop cycles long, so any audio that extends beyond two loop cycles during unfrozen
playback will be cut off after freezing.

Time-based effects like reverbs and delays are processed in real-time for unfrozen clips, so stopping
playback during a reverb or delay tail will allow the tail to continue. In contrast, frozen tails are
rendered as audio, and so will stop abruptly during playback.

Any parameter automations are rendered as part of the audio file for frozen Arrangement View clips.
Frozen Session View clips, however, take a “snapshot“ of all parameter values at the Arrangement‘s
1.1.1 position and retain them for the duration of the frozen clip. This is analogous to the behavior with
unfrozen clips; when playing normal clips in Session View, any Arrangement automations are
“punched out“ until the Back to Arrangement button is pressed.

Frozen clips are always played back with Warp on and in Beats mode, which means they are subject
to the same non-neutral behavior as any other warped audio files.

Any devices with random parameters (e.g., the Chance control in the Beat Repeat device) will no
longer exhibit random behavior after freezing. This is because, as with time-based effects, the random
values that were in place at the moment of freezing will be rendered as part of the new file, and will
thus no longer be calculated in real-time.

Please note that the Flatten command replaces any original clips and devices with the audio files
created by freezing. When using this command, it is important to keep in mind the special cases
above — what you hear after freezing is exactly what you will get when flattening, so if the results are
not to your liking, be sure to unfreeze and make any necessary changes to device parameters before
invoking the Flatten command.

This procedure is tested by rendering the output of an audio track and comparing it to the frozen
audio from the same track via phase cancellation to ensure that the files are identical.

36.2.8 Bypassed Effects

Bypassed effects in Live are removed from the signal flow. This is true for both Live‘s built-in effects
devices and third-party VST and AU plug-ins. Consequently, audio at the output of a bypassed effect
is identical to the audio at the input. Please note, however, that effects devices with parameters that
inherently require delay (e.g., the Lookahead settings in Compressor) will still introduce this delay
when bypassed, in order to maintain automatic delay compensation with the rest of the project. In
most cases, the effects of this behavior will be completely inaudible.

The neutrality of bypassed effects is tested by loading one instance of each of Live‘s effects devices
into an audio track, deactivating them, and then rendering the output of the track. The rendered file is
then compared to the rendered output of the same track with no loaded devices. Phase cancellation
testing of the two files confirms that they are identical.

36.2.9 Routing

The routing of signals within Live is a neutral operation. The signal at the routing destination will be
identical to the signal at the routing source. It is important to note that Live‘s flexible routing
architecture allows for a variety of scenarios, including routing from before or after any track‘s effects
or mixer and tapping the output of individual sample slots within the Impulse instrument. In these
cases, it is likely that the signal heard at the output point will be different from the signal heard prior to
routing, because it has been tapped before reaching the end of its original signal chain.

36.2.10 Splitting Clips

Clips which are already neutral will remain neutral after splitting. Splitting only affects playback
position within the sample, and has no effect on the sample data itself. Playback across a split
boundary is seamless and sample-accurate.

The neutrality of clip splitting is tested under a variety of conditions:

•
•

Splitting unwarped clips with loop on and off.
Splitting warped but unstretched clips with loop on and off.

In all cases, output is rendered and compared with the output of an unsplit version of the same source.
Phase cancellation testing of the two files confirms that they are identical.

36.3 Non-Neutral Operations

Procedures in Live that will cause a change in audio quality are referred to as non-neutral operations.
Users can be guaranteed that using these operations will cause at least some change to the signal.
Applying non-neutral operations to files imported into Live ensures that the imported audio will differ
from the files saved on disk. Applying non-neutral operations to files being exported from Live ensures
that what you hear during real-time playback will be different from what will end up in your new file.

Non-neutral operations are outlined below.

36.3.1 Playback in Complex and Complex Pro Mode

The algorithms used in the Complex and Complex Pro Warp Modes use an entirely different
technology from the algorithms behind Beats, Tones, Texture, and Re-Pitch modes. Although the
Complex modes may sound better, particularly when used with mixed sound files containing different
kinds of audio material, they are never neutral — not even at the original tempo. Because of this, and
because of the increased CPU demands of these algorithms, we recommend using them only in cases
where the other Warp Modes don‘t produce sufficient results.

36.3.2 Sample rate conversion/transposition

Sample rate conversion (during both real-time playback and rendering) is a non-neutral operation.
Playback of audio files at a sample rate that is different from the rate set in Live‘s Settings window will
cause signal degradation. Transposition is also a form of sample-rate conversion, and thus also results
in non-neutral behavior.

To minimize potential negative results during real-time playback, it is recommended to do sample rate
conversion as an offline process, rather than mixing files of different sample rates within a single Set.
Once the samples have been exported at the sample rate that you plan to use in Live, the files can be
imported without any loss of quality.

Rendering audio from Live with a sampling rate other than the one that was used while working on the
project is also a non-neutral operation. Sample rate conversion during export uses the extremely high-
quality SoX Resampler library, as licensed under the GNU LGPL v2.1, which results in downsampled
files with extremely low distortion.

36.3.3 Volume Automation

Automation of volume level results in a change in gain, which is necessarily a non-neutral operation.
But certain implementations of automation envelopes can result in audible artifacts, particularly if the
envelopes are not calculated at a fast enough rate. Volume automation curves are updated for each
audio sample, resulting in extremely low levels of distortion.

36.3.4 Dithering

Whenever rendering audio to a lower bit depth, it is a good idea to apply dithering in order to
minimize artifacts. Dithering (a kind of very low-level noise) is inherently a non-neutral procedure, but
it is a necessary evil when lowering the bit resolution.

Please note that Live‘s internal signal processing is all 32-bit, so applying even a single gain change
makes the resulting audio 32-bit as well — even if the original audio is 16- or 24-bit. Dither should
never be applied more than once to any given audio file, so unless you are mastering and finalizing
in Live, it is best to always render at 32-bit and avoid dithering altogether.

36.3.5 Recording external signals (bit depth < A/D converter)

Recording audio signals into Live is a non-neutral operation if the bit depth set in Live‘s Settings
window is lower than that of the A/D converters used for the recording. This is not recommended.

36.3.6 Recording internal sources below 32 bit

Audio that is recorded via internal routing will lose quality if the recording is made at a bit depth
below 32 bits. To ensure neutral recordings of plug-in instruments and any audio signals that are
being processed by effects plug-ins, internal recording at 32 bits is recommended. Please note,
however, that if the source audio is already at a lower bit depth, internal recording at that bit depth
will also be neutral (assuming that no effects are used); internally recording an unprocessed 16 bit
audio file at 32 bits will not increase the sound quality.

36.3.7 Consolidate

Consolidating clips in the Arrangement View creates new audio files, which are non-neutral in
comparison to the original audio data. Specifically, the new files will be normalized, with their clip
volumes adjusted to play back at the same volume as heard prior to consolidation. Normalization is a
gain change, which is a non-neutral operation. Also, the new files will be created at the sample rate
and bit depth set in Live‘s Settings window, which may differ from those in the original audio files.

36.3.8 Clip Fades

When Create Fades on Clip Edges is enabled in the Record, Warp & Launch Settings, a short (up to 4
ms) fade is applied to the clip start and end to avoid clicks at the clip edges. These “declicking“ fades
can also be applied to Session View clips via the Clip Fade button. Additionally, Arrangement View
clips have editable fades and crossfades. Applying any of these fade options is a non-neutral
operation.

36.3.9 Panning

Live uses constant power panning with sinusoidal gain curves. Output is 0 dB at the center position
and signals panned fully left or right will be increased by +3 dB. In order to minimize this volume
change, it may be helpful to narrow the overall stereo width before doing extreme panning. This can
be done via the Width control in the Utility device.

36.3.10 Grooves

Under most conditions, playback of a warped clip that is at the same tempo as the Set is a neutral
operation. However, if a groove is applied, playback will be non-neutral at any tempo.

36.4 Tips for Achieving Optimal Sound Quality

in Live

For users looking to achieve optimal audio quality in Live, we have provided a list of recommended
practices and program settings.

•

•

•

•
•
•

Decide which sample rate to use for a project prior to beginning work, rather than changing the
sample rate while working on the project.
Record audio into Live using high-quality hardware components (audio interface, cables, etc.)
and at the highest sample rate and bit depth your interface and computer will support.
Avoid using samples that are at different sample rates within the same project. If you want to
work with such files, we recommend that you first convert them to the sample rate set for your
audio interface in an offline application that is optimized for this task.
For all audio clips, disable both the Warp and Fade options in the Clip View.
Do not adjust the Transpose and Detune controls for any clips.
Always render at 32-bit.

Please note that these practices, while ensuring optimal audio quality, disable some of Live‘s
functionality — in particular, stretching and synchronization.

36.5 Conclusion

We hope this helps users to understand exactly how audio is affected when performing various
procedures in Live. Our focus has been on functions that have proven over the years to cause
confusion or uncertainty, and the list of both neutral and non-neutral operations presented here is
necessarily incomplete.

37. MIDI Fact Sheet

In conjunction with our work on the audio engine, Ableton has spent additional effort analyzing Live‘s
MIDI timing and making improvements where necessary. We wrote this fact sheet to help users
understand the problems involved in creating a reliable and accurate computer-based MIDI
environment, and to explain Live‘s approach to solving these problems.

The MIDI timing issues discussed in this chapter are generally not applicable to users with high-quality
audio and MIDI hardware. If you have already invested time and money into optimizing these factors
in your studio, and are not experiencing problems with MIDI timing, you probably do not need this
information.

37.1 Ideal MIDI Behavior

To understand how MIDI works within a digital audio workstation (DAW), it is helpful to introduce
some common terms and concepts. A DAW must be able to accommodate three distinct MIDI-related
scenarios:

1.

2.

3.

Recording refers to sending MIDI note and controller information from a hardware device (such
as a MIDI keyboard) into a DAW for storage. An ideal recording environment would capture
this incoming information with perfect timing accuracy in relation to the timeline of the song —
as accurately as an audio recording.
Playback refers to two related scenarios when dealing with DAWs. The first involves sending
MIDI note and controller information from the DAW to a hardware device such as a
synthesizer. The second involves converting stored MIDI information into audio data within the
computer, as played back by a plug-in device such as the Operator synthesizer. In both cases,
an ideal playback environment would output a perfect reproduction of the stored information.
Playthrough involves sending MIDI note and controller information from a hardware device
(such as a MIDI keyboard) into the DAW and then, in real-time, back out to a hardware
synthesizer or to a plug-in device within the DAW. An ideal playthrough environment would
“feel“ as accurate and responsive as a physical instrument such as a piano.

37.2 MIDI Timing Problems

The realities of computer-based MIDI are complex, and involve so many variables that the ideal
systems described above are impossible to achieve. There are two fundamental issues:

1.

2.

Latency refers to inherent and consistent delay in a system. This is a particular problem in a
DAW because digital audio cannot be transferred into or out of an audio interface in real time,
and must instead be buffered. But even acoustic instruments exhibit a certain degree of latency;
in a piano, for example, there is some amount of delay between the time a key is depressed
and the time the hammer mechanism actually activates the string. From a performance
perspective, small latency times are generally not a problem because players are usually able
to adapt the timing of their playing to compensate for delays — as long as the delays remain
consistent.
Jitter refers to inconsistent or random delay in a system. Within a DAW, this can be a particular
problem because different functions within the system (e.g., MIDI, audio and the user interface)
are processed separately. Information often needs to be moved from one such process to
another — when converting MIDI data into a plug-in‘s playback, for example. Jitter-free MIDI
timing involves accurate conversion between different clocks within the system‘s components —
the MIDI interface, audio interface, and the DAW itself. The accuracy of this conversion
depends on a variety of factors, including the operating system and driver architecture used.
Jitter, much more so than latency, creates the feeling that MIDI timing is “sloppy“ or “loose.“

37.3 Live’s MIDI Solutions

Ableton‘s approach to MIDI timing is based on two key assumptions:

1.

2.

In all cases, latency is preferable to jitter. Because latency is consistent and predictable, it can
be dealt with much more easily by both computers and people.
If you are using playthrough while recording, you will want to record what you hear — even if,
because of latency, this occurs slightly later than what you play.

Live addresses the problems inherent in recording, playback and playthrough so that MIDI timing will
be responsive, accurate and consistently reliable. In order to record incoming events to the correct
positions in the timeline of a Live Set, Live needs to know exactly when those events were received
from the MIDI keyboard. But Live cannot receive them directly — they must first be processed by the
MIDI interface‘s drivers and the operating system. To solve this problem, the interface drivers give
each MIDI event a timestamp as they receive it, and those are passed to Live along with the event so
that Live knows exactly when the events should be added to the clip.

During playthrough, a DAW must constantly deal with events that should be heard as soon as
possible, but which inevitably occurred in the past due to inherent latency and system delays. So a
choice must be made: should events be played at the moment they are received (which can result in

jitter if that moment happens to occur when the system is busy) or should they be delayed (which adds
latency)? Ableton‘s choice is to add latency, as we believe that it is easier for users to adjust to
consistent latency than to random jitter.

When monitoring is enabled during recording, Live adds an additional delay to the timestamp of the
event based on the buffer size of your audio hardware. This added latency makes it possible to record
events to the clip at the time you hear them — not the time you play them.

For playback of hardware devices, Live also generates timestamps that it attempts to communicate to
the MIDI interface drivers for scheduling of outgoing MIDI events. Windows MME drivers cannot
process timestamps, however, and for devices that use these drivers, Live schedules outgoing events
internally.

Even during high system loads that cause audio dropouts, Live will continue to receive incoming MIDI
events. In the event of audio dropouts, there may be timing errors and audio distortion during
playthrough, but Live should still correctly record MIDI events into clips. Later, when the system has
recovered from the dropouts, playback of these recorded events should be accurate.

37.4 Variables Outside of Live’s Control

In general, timestamps are an extremely reliable mechanism for dealing with MIDI event timing. But
timestamps are only applicable to data within the computer itself. MIDI data outside of the computer
can make no use of this information, and so timing information coming from or going to external
hardware is processed by the hardware as soon as it arrives, rather than according to a schedule.
Additionally, MIDI cables are serial, meaning they can only send one piece of information at a time.
In practice, this means that multiple notes played simultaneously cannot be transmitted simultaneously
through MIDI cables, but instead must be sent one after the other. Depending on the density of the
events, this can cause MIDI timing problems.

Another issue that can arise, particularly when working with hardware synthesizers from the early
days of MIDI, is that the scan time of the device may occur at a relatively slow rate. Scan time refers to
how often the synthesizer checks its own keyboard for input. If this rate is too slow, jitter may be
introduced.

Of course, any such timing problems present at the hardware level may be multiplied as additional
pieces of gear are added to the chain.

Even within the computer, the accuracy of timestamps can vary widely, depending on the quality of
the MIDI hardware, errors in driver programming, etc. Live must assume that any timestamps attached
to incoming MIDI events are accurate, and that outgoing events will be dealt with appropriately by
any external hardware. But both situations are impossible for Live to verify.

Tests and Results

Our procedure for testing the timing of incoming MIDI events is represented in the following diagram:

MIDI Input Test Configuration.

The output of a MIDI Source (a keyboard or other DAW playing long sequences of random MIDI
events) is fed to a zero-latency hardware MIDI Splitter. One portion of the splitter‘s output is recorded
into a new MIDI clip in Live. The other portion is fed to a MIDI-to-Audio Converter. This device
converts the electrical signal from the MIDI source into simple audio noise. Because the device does
not interpret the MIDI data, it performs this conversion with zero-latency. The converter‘s output is then
recorded into a new audio clip in Live. In an ideal system, each event in the MIDI clip would occur
simultaneously with the corresponding event in the audio clip. Thus the difference in timing between
the MIDI and audio events in the two clips can be measured to determine Live‘s accuracy.

In order to assess MIDI performance under a variety of conditions, we ran the tests with three different
audio/MIDI combo interfaces at different price points, all from well-known manufacturers. We will
refer to these interfaces as A, B and C. All tests were performed with a CPU load of approximately
50% on both macOS and Windows machines, at both 44.1 and 96 kHz and at three different audio
buffer sizes, for a total of 36 discrete test configurations.

Windows:

•

•

•

Interface A: The maximum jitter was +/- 4 ms, with the majority of the jitter occurring at +/- 1
ms.
Interface B: For most of the tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 3 or 4 ms. At 96 kHz and 1024
sample buffer, there were a small number of events with +/- 5 ms of jitter. At 44.1 kHz and 512
sample buffer, occasional events with +/- 6 ms occurred. In all cases, the majority of the jitter
occurred at +/- 1 ms.
Interface C: For most of the tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 5 ms. At 96 kHz and 512 sample
buffer, there were a small number of events with between +/- 6 and 8 ms of jitter. At 44.1 kHz
and 1024 sample buffer, there were a small number of events with jitter as high as +/- 10 ms.
In all cases, the majority of the jitter occurred at +/- 1 ms.

macOS:

•

•

•

Interface A: At 44.1 kHz and 1152 sample buffer, jitter was fairly evenly distributed between
+/- 4 and 11 ms. For all other tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 5 ms. In all tests, the majority of
the jitter occurred at +/- 1 ms.
Interface B: For most of the tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 4 or 5 ms. At 44.1 kHz and 1152
sample buffer, there was a fairly even distribution of jitter between +/- 2 and 11 ms. In all
cases, the majority of the jitter occurred at +/- 1 ms.
Interface C: In all tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 1 ms, with most events occurring with no
jitter.

We also performed a similar procedure for testing the timing of outgoing MIDI events, as represented
in the following diagram:

MIDI Output Test Configuration.

In all cases, the output tests showed comparable results to the input tests.

37.5 Tips for Achieving Optimal MIDI

Performance

In order to help users achieve optimal MIDI performance with Live, we have provided a list of
recommended practices and program settings.

•

•

•

Use the lowest possible buffer sizes available on your audio hardware, thereby keeping
latency to a minimum. Audio buffer controls are found in the Audio tab of Live‘s Settings, and
vary depending on the type of hardware you‘re using. For more information, see the Lesson
“Setting Up Audio I/O.“
Use a high quality MIDI interface with the most current drivers in order to ensure that MIDI
timestamps are generated and processed as accurately as possible.
Do not enable track monitoring if you are recording MIDI while listening directly to a hardware
device such as an external synthesizer (as opposed to listening to the device‘s audio through
Live via the External Instrument device). Likewise, disable track monitoring when recording MIDI
data that is generated by another MIDI device (such as a drum machine). When monitoring is
enabled, Live adds latency to compensate for playthrough jitter. Therefore, it is important to
only enable monitoring when actually playing through.

37.6 Summary and Conclusions

We hope this helps users understand a variety of related topics:

•

The inherent problems in computer-based MIDI systems.

•
•

Our approach to solving these problems in Live.
Additional variables that we cannot account for.

As mentioned before, the best way to solve MIDI timing issues in your studio is to use the highest-
quality hardware components available. For users of such components, all software MIDI systems
should perform with no noticeable issues. For users with less-than-optimal hardware, however, Live
still offers an additional degree of accuracy by minimizing jitter, but at the expense of a small amount
of additional latency.

38. Accessibility and Keyboard
Navigation

Live 12 offers new accessibility features on both macOS and Windows, including support for screen
readers and other assistive technologies that use the accessibility communication protocols native to
those operating systems. Additional improvements include a high-contrast option for new themes,
streamlined keyboard navigation, and a more organized Settings menu.

While most of Live’s views, controls, and devices work with screen readers, some device features have
not been optimized to do so, such as the Modulation Matrix in Wavetable and some advanced
parameters in Operator. Several other Live and third-party features are not yet supported for screen
reader use, including:

•
•
•
•

Browser tagging and filters
MPE editing in Clip View
Max for Live
Some third-party plug-ins

For answers to common questions about Live’s accessibility support, please refer to the Accessibility in
Ableton Live FAQ in the Knowledge Base.

38.1 Menu and Keyboard Navigation Settings

Various accessibility and keyboard navigation options can be found in Live’s Settings, as well as in the
Options and Navigate menus.

device settings.

Audio setup varies between macOS and Windows. On macOS, Live’s input and output can be
connected to any CoreAudio device. You can also select other drivers from the Driver Type drop-
down menu if needed. On Windows, you can select your preferred driver, for example ASIO4ALL,
and manage connected devices via the driver’s own program.

38.3 Connecting MIDI Devices

Live automatically detects connected MIDI devices, many of which require no further configuration.

Some MIDI controllers also come with control surface scripts to help integrate them into Live’s
workflows. Note that screen reader support for control surfaces varies between third-party
manufacturers, so some controllers may not be optimized for use with screen readers.

The MIDI section in the Link, Tempo & MIDI page has six Control Surface drop-down menus, where
you can select control surfaces using the dedicated keyboard navigation options. You can also
specify the input and output port settings for each selected control surface.

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

- 28.12.1 Architecture and Interface
- 28.12.2 String Tab
- 28.12.3 Filter/Global Tab

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

- “Note that the Damping knob is
unavailable when the Bow exciter is selected.”
- “Note that the LFO and Env sliders have no effect unless the Envelope and LFO
subsections are enabled.”
- “With Legato enabled, the sliding will only occur if the second note is played before the first note is
released.”
- “Note that Poly Voices is only active when the Poly/Mono switch is set to Poly.”
- “Note that
Glide is only active when the Poly/Mono switch is set to Mono.”
- “Note: Subtle sound differences may occur when Hi-Quality mode is enabled.”
- “When Snap is enabled, all breakpoints that you
create or reposition will snap to grid lines.”
- “When the Velocity switch is enabled, the envelope is modulated by note velocity.”
- “The X-Y controls are only active when using the S-shaped curve.”
- “When Snap is enabled, all breakpoints that you
create or reposition will snap to grid lines.”
- “Folders are only visible on Push 1 if they contain items that can be
loaded at any particular time.”
- “32.3.1 Loop Selector

When the Loop Selector layout is enabled, the pads are divided into three sections, allowing you to
simultaneously play, step sequence and adjust the length of your clip.”
- “When Record is enabled, the moving pad will be red.”
- “Fixed Y/N: When Fixed Mode is on, the notes on the pad grid remain in the same positions when you
change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play C, except in keys that don’t contain a C, in which
case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in the key.”
- “Scales — When Note Mode is on and an instrument track is selected, pressing this button allows you
to select which scale will be played on the pads.”
- “•

when you change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play C, except in keys that don’t
contain a C, in which case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in the key.”
- “Repeat — When Repeat is enabled, holding down a pad will retrigger the note.”
- “Accent — When Accent is enabled, all incoming notes (whether step sequenced or played in real-
time) are played at full velocity.”
- “Note that pitch bend and modulation wheel functionality is only available when playing instruments
in real time, and not when using the melodic step sequencers.”
- “When Note Mode is
selected, the Scene/Grid Section determines the rhythmic resolution of the step sequencer grid and
the rhythmic resolution of repeated notes when Repeat is enabled.”
- “The Layout Button

33.3.1 Loop Selector

When the Loop Selector layout is enabled, the pads are divided into three sections, allowing you to
simultaneously play, step sequence and adjust the length of your clip.”
- “When Record is enabled, the moving pad will be red.”
- “When Accent is enabled, all played or step-sequenced notes will be at full velocity
(127), regardless of how hard you actually tap the pads.”
- “Note that Accent overrides this behavior.”
- “If Phrase Sync is enabled, Push 2 treats the chosen length as a musical phrase,
and will begin recording from the position in the clip that corresponds to that position within a phrase
of that length.”
- “When Fixed is on, the notes on
the pad grid remain in the same positions when you change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play
C, except in keys that don’t contain a C, in which case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in
the key.”
- “Note that this parameter is only active
if Loop is enabled.”
- “836


With Trigger enabled, the sample will continue playing even after the pad is released; the amount of
time you hold the pad has no effect when Trigger is on.”
- “While working in Session Mode when the focus is on Clip Mode, the display is “folded”, which means
all notes within a clip will fit on the display at any given time.”
- “Note that
pitch bend and modulation wheel functionality is only available when playing instruments in real time,
and not when using the Melodic Sequencer.”
- “When
Note Mode is selected, the Scene/Grid buttons determine the rhythmic resolution of the step
sequencer grid and the rhythmic resolution of repeated notes when Repeat is enabled.”
- “862


Repeat — When Repeat is enabled, holding down a pad will retrigger the note.”
- “Accent — When Accent is enabled, all incoming notes (whether step sequenced or played in real-
time) are played at full velocity.”

- “Note that the metronome’s recording count-in cannot be used when Link is enabled.”
- “Note: Link, Tempo Follower, and External Sync are mutually exclusive; the Link and the External Sync
switches are disabled when Tempo Follower is enabled.”
- “Live can still send MIDI clock information to
external devices when Tempo Follower is enabled, but it cannot receive it.”
- “869


When Link is enabled, Live can send MIDI clock information to external devices, but cannot receive it;
the External Sync switch is disabled when Link is enabled.”
- “The MIDI Timecode Offset setting is also only relevant if “MIDI Timecode“ is chosen from the Sync
Type menu.”
- “36.3.8 Clip Fades

When Create Fades on Clip Edges is enabled in the Record, Warp & Launch Settings, a short (up to 4
ms) fade is applied to the clip start and end to avoid clicks at the clip edges.”
- “When monitoring is enabled during recording, Live adds an additional delay to the timestamp of the
event based on the buffer size of your audio hardware.”
- “Therefore, it is important to
only enable monitoring when actually playing through.”
- “38.1.1 Using Tab for Navigation

When the Use Tab Key to Move Focus option is enabled via the Navigate menu or Live’s Display &
Input Settings, the Tab key can be used to navigate in the following ways:

•
•

Tab moves to the next control.”
- “This option can be enabled via

Wrap Tab Navigation - When this option is enabled, pressing Tab moves focus back to the
first control after reaching the last one in an area instead of stopping.”
- “If the keyboard focus is on the first control of any
given Settings tab, use the Shift

Tab shortcut to return the focus to the Settings Page Chooser.”
