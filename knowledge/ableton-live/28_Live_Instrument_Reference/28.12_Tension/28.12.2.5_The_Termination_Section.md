# 28.12.2.5 The Termination Section

Tension’s Termination Section.

The Termination section models the interaction between the fret, finger and string. On a physical
instrument, this interaction is used to change the effective length of the string, which in turn sets the
pitch of the note played.

The Termination section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name.

The Finger Mass parameter can additionally be modulated by velocity or note pitch, via the Vel and
Key sliders.

The physical parameters of the finger are adjusted with the Finger Mass and Finger Stiff knobs, which
set the force the finger applies to the string and the finger’s stiffness, respectively. The stiffness of the
fret is modeled with the Fret Stiff parameter.
