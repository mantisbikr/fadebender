# 28.1.9 MPE Sources

Display Parameters for the MPE Sources.

Toggling the MPE switch in the Global section of the display reveals three MPE sources: Pressure,
Slide, and NotePB (per-note pitch bend), which can be used to further transform Analog’s sound.

You can specify up to two different destinations where MPE pressure data will be routed using the two
Pressure Destination choosers. You can set how much the MPE pressure data will modulate the
selected destinations using the MPE Pressure Amount sliders to the right.

Slide also includes two Destination choosers, each with its own MPE Slide Amount slider to control
how much the MPE slide data affects the target.

The Pressure and Slide Activity LEDs light up when Analog receives MPE pressure and slide data
respectively.

The Note PB slider sets the range of per-note pitch bend in semitones.
