# 28.1.1 Architecture and Interface

Analog’s signal flow is shown in the figure below:

Diagram of Analog’s Signal Flow.

The primary sound sources of the synthesizer are two oscillators and a noise generator. These sources
can be independently routed to two different multi-mode filters, which are each connected to an
amplifier. Furthermore, the signal flow can be run through the filters in series or in parallel.

Analog also features two low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) which can modulate the oscillators, filters
and amplifiers. Additionally, each filter and amplifier has its own envelope generator.

The Analog interface consists of two parts: the display surrounded on all sides by the shell. The shell
contains the most important controls for a given section while the display updates to show parameter
visualizations and additional controls for the section selected in the shell. In addition to the synthesis
modules, there is a Global section that contains general performance parameters such as instrument
volume, vibrato and polyphony, as well as an MPE section that includes controls for three MPE
sources: pressure, slide and per-note pitch bend, which make it possible to shape Analog’s sound
using an MPE-enabled controller.
