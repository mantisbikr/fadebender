# 28.1 Analog

The Analog Instrument.

Analog is a virtual analog synthesizer, created in collaboration with Applied Acoustics Systems. With
this instrument, we have not attempted to emulate a specific vintage analog synthesizer but rather to
combine different features of legendary vintage synthesizers into a modern instrument. Analog
generates sound by simulating the different components of the synthesizer through physical modeling.
This technology uses the laws of physics to reproduce how an object or system produces sound. In the
case of Analog, mathematical equations describing how analog circuits function are solved in real
time. Analog uses no sampling or wavetables; the sound is simply calculated in real time by the CPU
according to the values of each parameter. This sound synthesis method ensures unmatched sound
quality, realism, warmth and playing dynamics.

28.1.1 Architecture and Interface

Analog’s signal flow is shown in the figure below:

Diagram of Analog’s Signal Flow.

The primary sound sources of the synthesizer are two oscillators and a noise generator. These sources
can be independently routed to two different multi-mode filters, which are each connected to an
amplifier. Furthermore, the signal flow can be run through the filters in series or in parallel.

Analog also features two low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) which can modulate the oscillators, filters
and amplifiers. Additionally, each filter and amplifier has its own envelope generator.

The Analog interface consists of two parts: the display surrounded on all sides by the shell. The shell
contains the most important controls for a given section while the display updates to show parameter
visualizations and additional controls for the section selected in the shell. In addition to the synthesis
modules, there is a Global section that contains general performance parameters such as instrument
volume, vibrato and polyphony, as well as an MPE section that includes controls for three MPE
sources: pressure, slide and per-note pitch bend, which make it possible to shape Analog’s sound
using an MPE-enabled controller.

28.1.2 Oscillators

Display and Shell Parameters for the two Oscillators.

Analog’s two oscillators use physical modelling to capture the character of vintage hardware
oscillators. Because they use modelling instead of wavetables, they avoid aliasing.

Each oscillator can be turned on or off independently via the switch labelled Osc 1 or Osc 2 in the
shell, and the oscillator’s output level is adjusted by the slider to the right of this activator.

The F1/F2 slider controls the balance of the oscillator’s output to each of the two filters. When the
slider is at the center position, equal amounts of signal will be sent to both filters. When set all the way
to the top or bottom, signal will only be sent to Filter 1 or Filter 2 respectively.

The Shape chooser selects the oscillator’s waveform. The choices are sine, sawtooth, rectangular and
white noise. When rectangular is selected, the Pulse Width parameter is enabled in the display, which
allows you to change the pulse width of the waveform. Low Width values result in a very narrow
waveform, which tends to sound tinny or “pinched.“ At 100%, the waveform is a perfect square,
resulting in only odd harmonics. The pulse width can also be modulated by an LFO, via the slider next
to Width. Note that this parameter is only enabled when the corresponding LFO is enabled.

The Octave, Semi and Detune knobs in the shell function as coarse and fine tuners. Octave transposes
the oscillator by octaves, while Semi transposes up or down in semitone increments. The Detune knob
adjusts in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of three semitones (300 cents) up or down).

Oscillator pitch can be modulated according to the settings of the Pitch Mod and Pitch Env
parameters in the display. The LFO slider sets the amount that the LFO modulates pitch. Again, this
parameter is only enabled if the LFO is on. The Key slider controls how much the oscillator tuning is
adjusted by changes in MIDI note pitch. The default value of 100% means that the oscillator will
conform to a conventional equal tempered scale. Higher or lower values change the amount of space
between the notes on the keyboard. At 0%, the oscillator is not modulated by note pitch at all. To get
a sense of how this works, try leaving one of the oscillators at 100% and setting the other’s Key
scaling to something just slightly different. Then play scales near middle C. Since C3 will always
trigger the same frequency regardless of the Key value, the oscillators will get farther out of tune with
each other the farther away from C3 you play.

The Pitch Env settings apply a ramp that modulates the oscillator’s pitch over time. Initial sets the
starting pitch of the oscillator while Time adjusts how long it will take for the pitch to glide to its final
value. You can adjust both parameters via the sliders or by adjusting the breakpoints in the envelope
display.

The Sub/Sync parameters in the display allow you to apply either a sub-oscillator or a hard
synchronization mode. When the Mode chooser is set to Sub, the Level slider sets the output level of
an additional oscillator, tuned an octave below the main oscillator. The sub-oscillator produces a
square wave when the main oscillator’s Shape control is set to rectangle or sawtooth and a sine wave
when the main oscillator is set to sine. Note that the sub-oscillator is disabled when the main
oscillator’s Shape is set to white noise.

When the Mode chooser is set to Sync, the oscillator’s waveform is restarted by an internal oscillator
whose frequency is set by the Ratio slider. At 0%, the frequency of the internal oscillator and the
audible oscillator match, so sync has no effect. As you increase the Ratio, the internal oscillator’s rate
increases, which changes the harmonic content of the audible oscillator. For maximum analog
nastiness, try mapping a modulation wheel or other MIDI controller to the Sync ratio.

28.1.3 Noise Generator

Analog’s Noise Generator.

The Noise generator produces white noise and includes its own -6db/octave low-pass filter. The
generator can be turned on or off via the Noise switch in the shell. Its output level is adjusted by the
slider to the right of this activator.

The F1/F2 slider controls the balance of the noise generator’s output to each of the two filters. When
the slider is at the center position, equal amounts of signal will be sent to both filters. When set all the
way to the top or bottom, signal will only be sent to Filter 1 or Filter 2 respectively.

The Color knob sets the frequency of the internal low-pass filter. Higher values result in more high-
frequency content.

Note that Noise has only shell parameters, so adjusting them does not change what is shown in the
display.

28.1.4 Filters

Display and Shell Parameters for the two Filters.

Analog’s two multi-mode filters come equipped with a flexible routing architecture, multiple saturation
options and a variety of modulation possibilities. As with the oscillators, all parameters can be set
independently for each filter.

The Fil 1 and Fil 2 switches in the shell toggle the respective filter on and off. The chooser next to the
filter activator selects the filter type from a selection of 2nd and 4th order low-pass, band-pass, notch,
high-pass and formant filters.

The resonance frequency of the filter is adjusted with the Freq knob in the shell, while the amount of
resonance is adjusted with the Reso control. When a formant filter is chosen in the chooser, the Reso
control cycles between vowel sounds.

Below each mode chooser is an additional control which differs between the two filters. In Filter 1, the
To F2 slider allows you to adjust the amount of Filter 1’s output that will be sent to Filter 2. The Follow
switch below Filter 2’s mode chooser causes this filter’s cutoff frequency to follow the cutoff of Filter 1.
If this is enabled, Filter 2’s cutoff knob controls the amount of offset between the two cutoff amounts. If
any of Analog’s modulation sources are controlling Filter 1’s cutoff, Filter 2 will also be affected by
them when Follow is enabled.

In addition to the envelope controls, the displays for the filters contain various modulation parameters
and the Drive chooser. Cutoff frequency and resonance can be independently modulated by LFO,
note pitch and filter envelope via the sliders in the Freq Mod and Res Mod sections respectively.
Positive modulation values will increase the cutoff or resonance amounts, while negative values will
lower them.

The Drive chooser in the display selects the type of saturation applied to the filter output. The three Sym
options apply symmetrical distortion, which means that the saturation behavior is the same for positive
and negative values. The Asym modes result in asymmetrical saturation. For both mode types, higher
numbers result in more distortion. Drive can be switched off entirely by selecting Off in the chooser.
Experiment with the various options to get a sense of how they affect incoming signals.

28.1.5 Amplifiers

Display and Shell Parameters for the two Amplifiers.

After the filters, the signal is routed to an amplifier which further shapes the sound with an amplitude
envelope and panning. All parameters can be set independently for each amplifier.

The Amp 1 and Amp 2 switches in the shell toggle the respective amplifier on and off, while the output
level is controlled by the Level knob. The Pan knob sets the position of the amplifier’s output in the
stereo field.

In addition to the envelope controls, the displays for the amplifiers contain various modulation
parameters. The Pan and Level amounts can be independently modulated by LFO, note pitch and amp
envelope via the sliders in the Pan Mod and Level Mod sections respectively. Note that, when using
note pitch as the modulation source for Level, middle C will always sound the same regardless of the
modulation amount. Positive values will cause the level to increase for higher notes.

28.1.6 Envelopes

Analog’s Envelope Parameters.

In addition to the pitch envelopes in the oscillator sections, Analog is equipped with independent
envelopes for each filter and amplifier. All four of these envelopes have identical controls, which are
housed entirely within the display. Each envelope is a standard ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release)
design and features velocity modulation and looping capabilities.

The attack time is set with the Attack slider. This time can also be modulated by velocity via the Att <
Vel slider. As you increase the Att < Vel value, the attack time will become increasingly shorter at
higher velocities.

The time it takes for the envelope to reach the sustain level after the attack phase is set by the Decay
slider.

The Sustain slider sets the level at which the envelope will remain from the end of the decay phase to
the release of the key. When this knob is turned all the way to the left, there is no sustain phase. With it
turned all the way to the right, there is no decay phase.

The overall envelope level can be additionally modulated by velocity via the Env < Vel slider.

The S.Time slider can cause the Sustain level to decrease even if a key remains depressed. Lower
values cause the Sustain level to decrease more quickly.

Finally, the release time is set with the Release knob. This is the time it takes for the envelope to reach
zero after the key is released.

The Slope switches toggle the shape of the envelope segments between linear and exponential. This
change is also represented in the envelope visualization.

Normally, each new note triggers its own envelope from the beginning of the attack phase. With
Legato enabled, a new note that is played while another note is already depressed will use the first
note’s envelope, at its current position.

Enabling the Free switch causes the envelope to bypass its sustain phase and move directly from the
decay phase to the release phase. This behavior is sometimes called “trigger“ mode because it
produces notes of equal duration, regardless of how long the key is depressed. Free mode is ideal for
percussive sounds.

The Loop chooser offers several options for repeating certain segments of the envelope while a key is
depressed. When Off is selected, the envelope plays once through all of its segments without looping.

With AD-R selected, the envelope begins with the attack and decay phases as usual, but rather than
maintaining the sustain level, the attack and decay phases will repeat until the note is released, at
which point the release phase occurs. ADR-R mode is similar, but also includes the release phase in
the loop for as long as the key is held.

Note that in both AD-R and ADR-R modes, enabling Free will cause notes to behave as if they’re
permanently depressed.

ADS-R mode plays the envelope without looping, but plays the attack and release phases once more
when the key is released. With short attack and release times, this mode can simulate instruments with
audible dampers.

28.1.7 LFOs

Display and Shell Parameters for the two LFOs.

Analog’s two LFOs can be used as modulation sources for the oscillators, filters and amplifiers. As with
the other sections, each LFO has independent parameters.

The LFO 1 and LFO 2 switches in the shell toggle the respective LFO on and off, while the Rate knob
sets the LFO’s speed. The switch next to this knob toggles the Rate between frequency in Hertz and
tempo-synced beat divisions.

The Wave chooser in the display selects the waveform for the LFO. The choices are sine, triangle,
rectangle and two types of noise. The first noise type steps between random values while the second
uses smooth ramps. With Tri or Rect selected, the Width slider allows you to adjust the pulse width of
the waveform. With Tri selected, low Width values shift the waveform towards an upwards sawtooth,
while higher values result in a downward saw. At 50%, the waveform is a perfect triangle. The
behavior is similar with the Rect setting. At 50%, the waveform is a perfect square wave, while lower
and higher values result in negative or positive pulses, respectively. Note that Width is disabled when
the LFO’s waveform is set to sine or the noise modes.

The Delay slider sets how long it will take for the LFO to start after the note begins, while Attack sets
how long it takes the LFO to reach its full amplitude.

With Retrig enabled, the LFO restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered.
The Offset slider adjusts the phase of the LFO’s waveform.

28.1.8 Global Parameters

Display and Shell Parameters for the Global Options.

The Global shell and display parameters allow you to adjust Analog’s response to MIDI data and
controls for performance parameters such as vibrato and glide.

The Volume control in the shell adjusts the overall output of the instrument. This is the instrument’s
overall level, and can boost or attenuate the output of the amplifier sections.

The Vib switch turns the vibrato effect on or off, while the percentage slider next to it adjusts the
amplitude of the vibrato. Analog’s vibrato effect is essentially an additional LFO, but is hardwired to
the pitch of both oscillators. The Rate slider sets the speed of the vibrato.

Turning on the vibrato effect activates the four additional Vibrato parameters in the display. The Delay
slider sets how long it will take for the vibrato to start after the note begins, while Attack sets how long
it takes for the vibrato to reach full intensity. The Error slider adds a certain amount of random
deviation to the Rate, Amount, Delay and Attack parameters for the vibrato applied to each
polyphonic voice. The Amt < MW slider adjusts how much the modulation wheel will affect the vibrato
intensity. This control is relative to the value set in the vibrato amount percentage slider in the shell.

The Uni switch in the shell turns on the unison effect, which stacks multiple voices for each note played.
The Detune slider next to this switch adjusts the amount of tuning variation applied to each stacked
voice.

Turning on the unison effect activates the two additional Unison parameters in the display. The Voices
chooser selects between two or four stacked voices, while the Delay slider increases the lag time
before each stacked voice is activated.

The Gli switch turns the glide effect on or off. This is used to make the pitch slide between notes rather
than changing immediately. With Legato enabled, the sliding will only occur if the second note is
played before the first note is released. The Time slider sets the overall speed of the slide.

Turning on the glide effect activates an additional Glide Mode chooser in the display. Selecting Const
causes the glide time to be constant regardless of interval. Choosing Prop (proportional) causes the
glide time to be proportional to the interval between the notes. Large intervals will glide slower than
small intervals.

The four Quick Routing buttons on the left side of the display provide an easy way to quickly set up
common parameter routings. The upper left option configures a parallel routing structure, with each
oscillator feeding its own filter and amplifier exclusively. The upper right button is similar, but the

oscillators each split their output evenly between the two filters. The bottom left option feeds both
oscillators into Filter 1 and Amp 1, bypassing Filter 2 and Amp 2 entirely. Finally, the bottom right
option configures a serial routing structure, with both oscillators feeding Filter 1, which is then fed
exclusively to Filter 2 and Amp 2.

Note that the Quick Routing options do not affect any changes you may have made to the oscillator
level, tuning or waveform parameters — they only adjust the routing of the oscillators to the filters and
subsequent amplifiers.

The Keyboard section in the display contains all of Analog’s tuning and polyphony parameters. The
Octave, Semi and Detune controls function as coarse and fine tuners. Octave transposes the entire
instrument by octaves, while Semi transposes up or down in semitone increments. The Detune slider
adjusts tuning in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of 50 cents up or down).

PB Range sets the range of pitch bend modulation in semitones.

Stretch simulates a technique known as stretch tuning, which is a common tuning modification made to
electric and acoustic pianos. At 0%, Analog will play in equal temperament, which means that two
notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s.
Increasing the Stretch amount raises the pitch of upper notes while lowering the pitch of lower ones.
The result is a more brilliant sound. Negative values simulate “negative“ stretch tuning; upper notes
become flatter while lower notes become sharper.

The Error slider increases the amount of random tuning error applied to each note.

The Voices chooser sets the available polyphony, while Priority determines which notes will be cut off
when the maximum polyphony is exceeded. When Priority is set to High, new notes that are higher
than currently sustained notes will have priority, and notes will be cut off starting from the lowest pitch.
Low is the opposite. A Priority setting of Last gives priority to the most recently played notes, cutting off
the oldest notes as necessary.

28.1.9 MPE Sources

Display Parameters for the MPE Sources.

Toggling the MPE switch in the Global section of the display reveals three MPE sources: Pressure,
Slide, and NotePB (per-note pitch bend), which can be used to further transform Analog’s sound.

You can specify up to two different destinations where MPE pressure data will be routed using the two
Pressure Destination choosers. You can set how much the MPE pressure data will modulate the
selected destinations using the MPE Pressure Amount sliders to the right.

Slide also includes two Destination choosers, each with its own MPE Slide Amount slider to control
how much the MPE slide data affects the target.

The Pressure and Slide Activity LEDs light up when Analog receives MPE pressure and slide data
respectively.

The Note PB slider sets the range of per-note pitch bend in semitones.
