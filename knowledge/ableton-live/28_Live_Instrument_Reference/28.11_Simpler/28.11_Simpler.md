# 28.11 Simpler

The Simpler Instrument.

Simpler is an instrument that integrates the basic elements of a sampler with a set of classic synthesizer
parameters. A Simpler voice plays a user-defined region of a sample, which is in turn processed by
envelope, filter, LFO, volume and pitch components. But unlike a conventional sampler, Simpler
includes some unique functionality inherited from Live’s clips. Specifically, Simpler can play back
samples using Live’s warping. Warped samples will play back at the tempo of your Set, regardless of
which note you play. Warping in Simpler works in much the same way as it does in audio clips, and
bringing a warped clip into Simpler from an audio track, the browser, or your desktop preserves your

manual warp settings. For more information about warping, see the Audio Clips, Tempo, and Warping
chapter.

Simpler’s interface is divided into two sections: the Sample and Controls tabs. To get an even better
view, you can toggle the location of the Sample controls between the device chain and Live’s main
window by clicking the
parameters in the Controls tab fill Simpler in the Device View.

 button in Simpler’s title bar. When using this expanded view, the

The Sample Tab displays the sample waveform. Samples can be dragged into Simpler either directly
from the browser, or from the Session or Arrangement View in the form of clips. In the latter case,
Simpler will use only the section of the sample demarcated by the clip’s start/end or loop markers.
Any adjustments that have been made to a clip’s Warp Markers and other warping properties will be
retained when dragging a clip into Simpler. Samples can be replaced by dragging in a new sample,
or by activating the Hot-Swap button in the lower-right corner of the waveform display.

(Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier.

28.11.1 Playback Modes

The most important parameter that determines how Simpler will treat samples is the mode switch,
which is used to choose one of Simpler’s three playback modes. This switch is found on the left side of
the Sample tab or along the bottom of the expanded sample view.

Classic Playback Mode is the default mode when using Simpler, and is optimized for creating
“conventional” melodic and harmonic instruments using pitched samples. It features a complete
ADSR envelope and supports looping, allowing for samples to sustain as long as a note is held
down. Classic Mode is polyphonic by default.
One-Shot Playback Mode is exclusively for monophonic playback, and is optimized for use
with one-shot drum hits or short sampled phrases. This mode has simplified envelope controls
and does not support looping. By default, the entire sample will play back when a note is
triggered, regardless of how long the note is held.
Slicing Playback Mode non-destructively slices the sample so that the individual slices can be
played back chromatically. You can create and move slices manually, or choose from a number
of different options for how Simpler will automatically create slices. This mode is ideal for
working with rhythmic drum breaks.

28.11.1.1 Classic Playback Mode

The Sample Tab in Classic Playback Mode.

In Classic Playback Mode, the various sample position controls change which region of the sample
you play back. These controls include the Start and Length parameters as well as the two “flags” that

appear in the waveform display. The left flag sets the absolute position in the sample from which
playback can start, while the End control sets where playback can end. Start and Length are then
represented in percentages of the total sample length enabled by the flags. For example, a Length
value of 50% will play exactly half of the region between the flags. The Loop slider determines how
much of the available sample will loop. This parameter is only active if the Loop switch is enabled.

It’s possible to create sustaining loops that are so short they take on a glitchy or granular character, or
even take on a pitch as a result of looping at audio rates. While this might be exactly the effect you
want, it can cause very high CPU loads, particularly when working with the Complex or Complex Pro
Warp Modes.

Quite often, you’ll start with a longer region of a sample and end up using only a small part of it.
Simpler’s waveform display can be zoomed and panned just as in other parts of Live — drag
vertically or scroll with the mousewheel or trackpad while holding the Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac)
modifier to zoom, and drag horizontally to pan different areas of the sample into view. Zooming
works the same in all three playback modes.

Pressing the Loop On/Off button determines whether or not the sample will loop when a note is held
down. It is possible for glitches or pops to occur between a looped sample’s start and end points due
to the discontinuity in waveform amplitude (i.e., the sample’s loudness). The Snap switch will help
mitigate these by forcing Simpler’s loop and region markers to snap to zero-crossing points in the
sample (points where the amplitude is zero). Snapping is based on the left channel of stereo samples.
It is therefore still possible, even with Snap activated, to encounter glitches with stereo samples.

The transition from loop end to loop start can be smoothed with the Fade control, which crossfades the
two points. This method is especially useful when working with long, textural samples.

The Gain slider allows you to boost or cut the level of the sample. Note that this is a separate gain
stage from Simpler’s Volume knob, which determines the final output level of the entire instrument
(after processing through Simpler’s filter). This parameter is available in all three playback modes.

The Voices parameter sets the maximum number of voices that Simpler can play simultaneously. If
more voices are needed than have been allocated by the Voices chooser, “voice stealing“ will take
place, in which the oldest voice(s) will be dropped in favor of those that are new. For example, if your
Voices parameter is set to 8, and ten voices are all vying to be played, the two oldest voices will be
dropped. (Simpler does try to make voice stealing as subtle as possible.)

With Retrig enabled, a note that is already sustaining will be cut off if the same note is played again. If
Retrig is disabled, multiple copies of the same note can overlap. Note that Retrig only has an audible
effect if the sample has a long release time and the number of Voices is set to more than one.

The various warp parameters are the same in all three playback modes and are discussed below.

28.11.1.2 One-Shot Playback Mode

The Sample Tab in One-Shot Playback Mode.

In One-Shot Playback Mode, the left and right flags set the available playback region, as they do in
Classic Mode, but there are no Loop or Length controls. There is also no Voices control; One-Shot
Mode is strictly monophonic.

With Trigger enabled, the sample will continue playing even after the note is released; the amount of
time you hold the pad has no effect when Trigger is on.

You can shape the volume of the sample using the Fade In and Fade Out controls. Fade In determines
how long it takes the sample to reach its maximum volume after a note is played, while Fade Out
begins a fade out the specified amount of time before the end of the sample region.

With Gate enabled, the sample will begin fading out as soon as you release the note. The Fade Out
time determines how long it will take to fade to silence after release.

Snap works similarly to its function in Classic Mode, but only affects the start and end flags (because
there are no loop options.)

28.11.1.3 Slicing Playback Mode

The Sample Tab in Slicing Playback Mode.

In Slicing Playback Mode (as in One-Shot Playback Mode), the left and right flags set the available
playback region.

The Slice By chooser determines the specific way in which slices will be created:

•

Transient - Slices are placed on the sample’s transients automatically. The Sensitivity slider
determines how sensitive Simpler is to transient levels within the sample, and thus how many

slices will be automatically created. Higher numbers result in more slices, up to a maximum of
64 slices.
Beat - Slices are placed at musical beat divisions. The Division chooser selects the beat division
at which Simpler will slice the sample region.
Region - Slices are placed at equal time divisions. The Regions chooser selects the number of
evenly-spaced slices that will be created.
Manual - Slices are created manually, by double-clicking within the sample region. When
Manual is selected, no slices are placed automatically.

•

•

•

The Playback chooser determines how many slices can be triggered simultaneously. Mono is
monophonic; only one slice can be played at a time. When set to Poly, multiple slices can be
triggered together. The Voices and Retrig controls are available with Poly enabled, and work as they
do in Classic Playback Mode. When set to Thru, playback is monophonic, but triggering one slice will
continue playback through the rest of the sample region.

The Trigger/Gate switch works the same as it does in One-Shot Playback Mode. The Fade In and Out
controls behave slightly differently, depending on the setting of the Playback chooser. With Mono or
Poly selected, the Fade times are measured from the beginning to the end of each individual slice,
while with Thru selected, they are measured from the triggered slice to the end of the region. This
means that the fade times may sound different depending on where in the region you trigger.

Automatically created slices appear as vertical blue lines on the waveform display. Double-clicking a
slice deletes it. If you’re not satisfied with Simpler’s automatic slice placement, you can click and drag
a slice to move it to a new position. Double-clicking on the waveform between slices will create
manual slices, which appear white. In Transients mode, holding Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) and
clicking on a slice will toggle it between a manual and automatic slice. Manually created slices in
Transients mode are preserved regardless of the Sensitivity amount.

28.11.2 Warp Controls

Simpler’s Warp Controls.

When the Warp switch is off, Simpler behaves like a “conventional” sampler; as you play back the
sample at different pitches, the sample plays back at different speeds. In some cases, this is exactly the
effect that you want. But when working with samples that have their own inherent rhythm, you may
want to enable Warp. This will cause Simpler to play back the sample in sync with your current song
tempo, regardless of which notes you play.

If you’re familiar with how warping works in audio clips, you’ll find that Simpler’s Warp Modes and
settings behave in the same way. For more information, see the section called Warp Modes.

The Warp as… button adjusts the warping of the sample so that it will play back precisely within the
specified number of bars or beats. Live makes its best guess about what this value should be based on
the length of the sample, but if it gets it wrong, you can use the ÷2 or ×2 buttons to double or halve the
playback speed, respectively.

28.11.3 Filter

Simpler’s Filter Controls.

Simpler’s filter section offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch,
and a special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 12 and 24 dB slopes as well as a
selection of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate
hardware filters found on some classic analog synthesizers.

The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ
Eight. This is available for all of the filter types.

The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping
diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all
filter types.

The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on
the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and
high-pass filters.

The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of
both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.

The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters
used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass
and high-pass filters.

The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance.
Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts
frequencies near that point.

When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is
an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the
filter.

The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-
pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.

You can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via
dedicated options in the context menu of the Morph knob.

The Frequency and Envelope buttons in the filter section’s display area toggle between showing the
filter’s frequency response and its envelope. Filter cutoff frequency and resonance can be adjusted via
the knobs or by dragging the filter response curve in the display area. Filter frequency can also be
modulated by the following:

•
•
•
•

Note velocity, via the Vel control in the filter’s display.
Note pitch, via the Key control in the filter’s display.
Filter envelope, via the Envelope control in the filter’s display.
LFO, via the Filter slider in the LFO section.

28.11.4 Envelopes

Simpler’s Filter and Amplitude Envelope Controls.

Simpler contains three classic ADSR envelopes, as seen in most synthesizers, for shaping the dynamic
response of the sample. Amplitude, filter frequency, and pitch modulation are all modifiable by
toggling their respective buttons in the envelope section. Attack controls the time in milliseconds that it
takes for the envelope to reach its peak value after a note is played. Decay controls the amount of
time it takes for the envelope to drop down to the Sustain level, which is held until the note is released.
Release time is the amount of time after the end of the note that it takes for the envelope to drop from
the Sustain level back down to zero. These parameters can be adjusted via their dedicated controls or
graphically, by dragging the handles within the envelope visualizations.

The influence of envelopes on the filter cutoff and pitch can be set using the envelope amount controls
in the top right of each of these sections.

The Filter and Pitch Envelope Amount Controls.

The Amplitude Envelope can be looped via the Loop Mode chooser. For Loop and Trigger modes, if a
note is still held when the Decay stage ends, the envelope will restart from its initial value. The time it
takes to move from the Sustain level to the initial value is defined by the Time parameter. For Beat and
Sync modes, if a note is still held after the amount set in the Rate slider, the envelope will restart from
its initial value.

The Amplitude Envelope Loop Mode Chooser and Time Control.

28.11.5 LFO

Simpler’s LFO Section.

The LFO (low-frequency oscillator) section offers sine, square, triangle, sawtooth down, sawtooth up
and random waveforms. The LFO runs freely at frequencies between 0.01 and 30 Hz, or synced to
divisions of the Set’s tempo. LFOs are applied individually to each voice, or played note, in Simpler.

The time required for the LFO to reach full intensity is determined by the Attack control. The R switch
toggles Retrigger. When enabled, the LFO’s phase is reset to the Offset value for each new note. Note
that Offset has no effect when Retrigger is disabled.

The Key parameter scales each LFO’s Rate in proportion to the pitch of incoming notes. A high Key
setting assigns higher notes a higher LFO rate. If Key is set to zero, all voices’ LFOs have the same rate
and may just differ in their phase.

The Volume, Pitch, Pan, and Filter sliders determine how much the LFO will modulate the volume, pitch,
pan, and filter, respectively.

28.11.6 Global Parameters

Simpler’s Global Parameters.

Panorama is defined by the Pan control, but can be further swayed by randomness (via the Random >
Pan slider) or modulated by the LFO.

Simpler also offers a special Spread parameter that creates a rich stereo chorus by using two voices
per note and panning one to the left and one to the right. The two voices are detuned, and the amount
of detuning can be adjusted with the Spread control.

Whether or not spread is applied to a particular note depends upon the setting of the Spread
parameter during the Note On event. To achieve special effects, you could, for instance, create a
sequence where Spread is zero most of the time and turned on only for some notes. These notes will
then play in stereo, while the others will play mono.

The output volume of Simpler is controlled by the Volume control, which can also be dependent upon
note velocity, as adjusted by the Velocity > Volume control. Tremolo effects can be achieved by
allowing the LFO to modulate the Volume parameter.

Simpler plays back a sample at its original pitch if the incoming MIDI note is C3, however the
Transpose control allows transposing this by +/- 48 semitones. Pitch can also be modulated by the
LFO or pitch envelope. The pitch envelope is especially helpful in creating percussive sounds. Simpler
reacts to MIDI Pitch Bend messages with a sensitivity of +/- 5 semitones. You can also modulate the
Transpose parameter with clip envelopes and external controllers. For fine tuning of the pitch, use the
Detune control, which can be adjusted +/- 50 cents.

Simpler includes a glide function. When this function is activated, new notes will start from the pitch of
the last note played and then slide gradually to their own pitch. Two glide modes are available:
Glide, which works monophonically, and Portamento, which works polyphonically. The speed of the
glide is set with the Time control.

28.11.7 Context Menu Options for Simpler

A number of Simpler’s features are only accessible by opening the context menu via the sample
display or Simpler’s title bar.

By default, Simpler uses constant-power fades. But by turning off “Use Constant Power Fade for
Loops“ in the context menu of Simpler’s title bar, you can enable linear crossfades. Note that the Fade
parameter is not available when warp is enabled.

Presets created in Simpler can be converted for use in Sampler, and vice-versa. To do this, right-click
on Simpler’s title bar and choose the Simpler -> Sampler command. In this way, presets created in
Simpler can be in a multisample context in Sampler. Note, however, that Simpler’s warping and
slicing functionality is not available in Sampler, and presets that use any of these functions will sound
and behave very differently in Sampler.

Manage Sample reveals the loaded sample in Live’s File Manager, while the Show in Browser option
reveals the sample in Live’s browser. Show in Finder/Explorer reveals the sample within its folder in
your computer’s operating system. Note that this command is not available when working with
samples that have been loaded from official Ableton Packs.

Normalize Volumes adjusts the volume of the loaded sample so that its highest peak uses all of the
available headroom.

Crop removes the portions of the sample that are outside of the Start and End points, while Reverse
plays the entire sample backwards. Note that both Crop and Reverse are non-destructive; they create
a copy of the sample and apply the process to the copy, so your original sample is not changed.

When working in Slicing Playback Mode, two additional context menu options are available: Slice to
Drum Rack replaces the Simpler with a Drum Rack in which each of the current slices is split onto its
own pad. Slice to New MIDI Track is similar, but this creates an additional track containing a Drum
Rack rather than replacing the current Simpler. Additionally, when slicing to a new track, a clip is
created that plays back the slices in order. For more about slicing, see the dedicated section for this
topic.

28.11.8 Strategies for Saving CPU Power

Real-time synthesis needs lots of computing power. However, there are strategies for reducing CPU
load. Save the CPU spent on Simpler by doing some of the following:

•

•
•

•
•

When using warping, be aware that the Complex and Complex Pro modes use significantly
more CPU power than the other Warp Modes.
Turn off the Filter if it is not needed.
A filter’s CPU cost correlates with the steepness of its slope — the 24 dB slope is more
expensive than the 12 dB slope.
Turn off the LFO for a slightly positive influence on CPU.
Stereo samples need significantly more CPU than mono samples, as they require twice the
processing.

•
•

Decrease the number of simultaneously allowed voices with the Voices control.
Turn Spread to 0% if it is not needed.
