# 28.11.2 Warp Controls

Simpler’s Warp Controls.

When the Warp switch is off, Simpler behaves like a “conventional” sampler; as you play back the
sample at different pitches, the sample plays back at different speeds. In some cases, this is exactly the
effect that you want. But when working with samples that have their own inherent rhythm, you may
want to enable Warp. This will cause Simpler to play back the sample in sync with your current song
tempo, regardless of which notes you play.

If you’re familiar with how warping works in audio clips, you’ll find that Simpler’s Warp Modes and
settings behave in the same way. For more information, see the section called Warp Modes.

The Warp as… button adjusts the warping of the sample so that it will play back precisely within the
specified number of bars or beats. Live makes its best guess about what this value should be based on
the length of the sample, but if it gets it wrong, you can use the ÷2 or ×2 buttons to double or halve the
playback speed, respectively.
