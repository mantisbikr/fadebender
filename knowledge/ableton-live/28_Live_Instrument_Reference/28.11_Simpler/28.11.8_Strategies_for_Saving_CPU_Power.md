# 28.11.8 Strategies for Saving CPU Power

Real-time synthesis needs lots of computing power. However, there are strategies for reducing CPU
load. Save the CPU spent on Simpler by doing some of the following:

•

•
•

•
•

When using warping, be aware that the Complex and Complex Pro modes use significantly
more CPU power than the other Warp Modes.
Turn off the Filter if it is not needed.
A filter’s CPU cost correlates with the steepness of its slope — the 24 dB slope is more
expensive than the 12 dB slope.
Turn off the LFO for a slightly positive influence on CPU.
Stereo samples need significantly more CPU than mono samples, as they require twice the
processing.

•
•

Decrease the number of simultaneously allowed voices with the Voices control.
Turn Spread to 0% if it is not needed.
