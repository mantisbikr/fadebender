# 28.11.5 LFO

Simpler’s LFO Section.

The LFO (low-frequency oscillator) section offers sine, square, triangle, sawtooth down, sawtooth up
and random waveforms. The LFO runs freely at frequencies between 0.01 and 30 Hz, or synced to
divisions of the Set’s tempo. LFOs are applied individually to each voice, or played note, in Simpler.

The time required for the LFO to reach full intensity is determined by the Attack control. The R switch
toggles Retrigger. When enabled, the LFO’s phase is reset to the Offset value for each new note. Note
that Offset has no effect when Retrigger is disabled.

The Key parameter scales each LFO’s Rate in proportion to the pitch of incoming notes. A high Key
setting assigns higher notes a higher LFO rate. If Key is set to zero, all voices’ LFOs have the same rate
and may just differ in their phase.

The Volume, Pitch, Pan, and Filter sliders determine how much the LFO will modulate the volume, pitch,
pan, and filter, respectively.
