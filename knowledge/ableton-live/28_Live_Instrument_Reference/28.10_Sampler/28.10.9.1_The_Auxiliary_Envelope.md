# 28.10.9.1 The Auxiliary Envelope

On the left, the Auxiliary (Aux) envelope functions much like the envelopes in the Pitch/Osc tab, with
Initial, Peak, Sustain and End levels, ADSR, Loop mode and slope points. This envelope can be routed
to 29 destinations in both the A and B choosers. How much the Auxiliary envelope will modulate
destinations A and B is set in the two sliders to the right.
