# 28.10.11 Importing Third-Party Multisamples

Sampler can use the following third-party sample formats:

•
•
•

REX files (supported in Live Standard and Suite only)
ACID Loops
Soundtrack Loops

Note that the tags in ACID Loops or Soundtrack Loops are not accessible in Live.

To import a third-party multisample, navigate to the file in Live‘s browser and drag it into a Live Set.
This will import it into your User Library.

Importing will create new Sampler presets, which you can find in the browser under User Library/
Sampler/Imports.

Note that some multisample files will be converted to Instrument Rack presets that contain several
Sampler instances used to emulate the original more accurately.
