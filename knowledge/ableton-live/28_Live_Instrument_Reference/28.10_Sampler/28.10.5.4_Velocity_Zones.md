# 28.10.5.4 Velocity Zones

The Velocity Zone Editor.

Velocity zones determine the range of MIDI Note On velocities (1-127) that each sample will respond
to. The timbre of most musical instruments changes greatly with playing intensity. Therefore, the best
multisamples capture not only individual notes, but also each of those notes at different velocities.

The Velocity Zone Editor, when toggled, appears alongside the sample layer list. Velocity is measured
on a scale of 1-127, and this number range appears across the top of the editor. The functionality of
the Velocity Zone Editor is otherwise identical to that of the Key Zone Editor.
