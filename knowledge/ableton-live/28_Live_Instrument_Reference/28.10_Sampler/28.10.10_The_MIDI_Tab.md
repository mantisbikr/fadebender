# 28.10.10 The MIDI Tab

The MIDI Tab.

The MIDI tab’s parameters turn Sampler into a dynamic performance instrument. The MIDI controllers
Key, Velocity, Release Velocity, Aftertouch, Modulation Wheel, Foot Controller and Pitch Bend can be
mapped to two destinations each, with varying degrees of influence determined in the Amount A and
Amount B sliders.

For example, if we set Velocity’s Destination A to Loop Length, and its Amount A to 100, high
velocities will result in long loop lengths, while low velocities will create shorter ones.

At the bottom is a Pitch Bend Range slider (0 to 24 steps). The 14-bit range of pitch wheel values can
be scaled to produce up to 24 semitones of pitch bend in Sampler.

Finally, clicking in the Sampler image on the right will trigger a scrolling, movie-like credits for
Sampler. These are the people you can thank!
