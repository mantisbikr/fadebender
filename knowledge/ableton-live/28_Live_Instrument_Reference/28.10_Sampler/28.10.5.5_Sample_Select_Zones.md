# 28.10.5.5 Sample Select Zones

The Sample Select Editor.

Each sample also has a Sample Select zone, which is a data filter that is not tied to any particular
kind of MIDI input. Sample Select zones are very similar to the Chain Select Zones found in Racks, in
that only samples with sample select values that overlap the current value of the sample selector will
be triggered.

The Sample Select Editor, when toggled, appears alongside the sample layer list. The editor has a
scale of 0-127, similar to the Velocity Zone Editor. Above the value scale is the draggable indicator
known as the sample selector.

The Sample Selector.

The position of the sample selector only determines which samples are available for triggering. Once
a sample has been triggered, changing the position of the sample selector will not switch to a different
sample during playback.
