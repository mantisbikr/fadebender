# 28.10.2 Multisampling

Before going on, let’s introduce the concept of multisampling. This technique is used to accurately
capture the complexity of instruments that produce dynamic timbral changes. Rather than rely on the
simple transposition of a single recorded sample, multisampling captures an instrument at multiple
points within its critical sonic range. This typically means capturing the instrument at different pitches as
well as different levels of emphasis (played softly, moderately, loudly, etc.). The resulting multisample
is a collection of all the individually recorded sample files.

The acoustic piano, for example, is a commonly multisampled instrument. Because the piano’s pitch
and dynamic ranges are very wide and timbrally complex, transposing one sample across many
octaves would not reproduce the nuances of the instrument. Since multisampling relies on different
sound sources, three or more samples per piano key could be made (soft, medium, loud, very loud,
and so on), maximizing the sampler’s expressive possibilities.

Sampler is designed to let you approach multisampling on whatever level you like: you can load and
play multisample presets, import multisamples from third-party vendors, or create your own

multisamples from scratch. Lastly, you do not have use multisamples at all — drop a single sample into
Sampler and take advantage of its internal modulation system however you like.
