# 28.10.1 Getting Started with Sampler

Getting started with Sampler is as easy as choosing a preset from the browser. Like all of Live‘s
devices, Sampler’s presets are located in folders listed beneath its name. Presets imported from third-
party sample libraries are listed here, too, in the Imports folder.

Once you have loaded a Sampler preset into a track, remember to arm the track for recording (which
also enables you to hear any MIDI notes you might want to play), and then start playing!
