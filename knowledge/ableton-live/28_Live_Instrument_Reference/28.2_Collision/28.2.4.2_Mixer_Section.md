# 28.2.4.2 Mixer Section

Resonator Mixer.

Each resonator has its own Gain and Pan controls. Pan can also be modulated by note pitch via the
Key slider in the MIDI tab.

The Bleed control mixes a portion of the original oscillator signal with the resonated signal. At higher
values, more of the original signal is applied. This is useful for restoring high frequencies, which can
often be damped when the tuning or quality are set to low values.

Gain adjusts the output level of the selected resonator.
