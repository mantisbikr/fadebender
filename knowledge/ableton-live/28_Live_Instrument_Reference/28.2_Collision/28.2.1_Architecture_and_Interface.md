# 28.2.1 Architecture and Interface

Collision’s sound is produced by a pair of oscillators called Mallet and Noise, which feed a pair of
independent (or linked) stereo resonators. While the oscillators produce the initial component of the
sound, it is the resonator parameters that have the greatest impact on the sound’s character.

Note that if both the Mallet and Noise sections are turned off, Collision will not produce any sound.

Collision’s interface is divided into sections and tabs. The Mallet and Noise sections contain controls
for the corresponding Mallet and Noise oscillators. The Resonator 1 and Resonator 2 tabs contain
parameters for both individual resonators.

The LFO tab contains two independent low-frequency oscillators (LFOs), which can each modulate
multiple parameters. Similarly, the MIDI/MPE tab allows for MIDI pitch bend, modulation wheel and

aftertouch messages and their MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) equivalents to be routed to multiple
destinations.

To the right of the MIDI/MPE tab is a section of global parameters, including voice polyphony, note
retrigger, resonator structure, and overall output volume.

Note: Deactivating unused sections and tabs can help to save CPU resources.
