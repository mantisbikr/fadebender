# 28.2.2 Mallet Section

Collision’s Mallet Section.

The Mallet section simulates the impact of a mallet against a surface. The parameters adjust the
physical properties of the mallet itself.

You can toggle the Mallet button to switch the section on or off.

Volume controls the overall output level of the mallet. The Volume parameter can be modulated using
pitch and velocity by adjusting the Key and Vel sliders in the MIDI tab.

Stiffness adjusts the hardness of the mallet. At low levels, the mallet is soft, which results in fewer high
frequencies and a longer, less distinct impact. As you increase the stiffness, the impact time decreases
and high frequencies increase. This parameter can also be modulated by pitch and velocity via the
Key and Vel sliders in the MIDI tab.

Noise sets the amount of impact noise that is included in each mallet strike. This is useful for simulating
the “chiff“ sound of a felt-wrapped mallet head. The Noise parameter can be modulated using pitch
and velocity by adjusting the Key and Vel sliders in the MIDI tab.

Color sets the frequency of the noise component. At higher values, there are less low frequencies in
the noise. This parameter has no effect if Noise is set to 0.

28.2.3 Noise Section

Collision’s Noise Section.

Like the Mallet, the Noise section produces Collision’s initial impulse sound. The Noise oscillator
produces white noise, which is then fed into a multimode filter with a dedicated envelope generator.
This section can be used instead of, or in addition to, the Mallet section.

You can toggle the Noise button to switch the section on or off.

Next to the Noise button is a drop-down menu for the available noise filter types. You can choose
between LP, HP, BP, and LP+HP. Filter cutoff and resonance can be adjusted by using the Freq knob
and Res slider.

In BP mode, the Res slider adjusts resonance, while in LP+HP mode, it adjusts bandwidth. The filter
frequency can also be modulated by note pitch, velocity, or the envelope generator, via the Key and
Vel sliders in the MIDI tab or the Env Amt knob control.

Volume sets the overall output level of the Noise section, and can be modulated by pitch and velocity
by adjusting the Key and Vel sliders in the MIDI tab.

The Env Amt knob controls an envelope generator with standard ADSR (attack, decay, sustain,
release) options.

The attack time — how quickly Noise reaches full volume — is set with the A (Attack) slider, while the
time it takes for the envelope to reach the sustain level after the attack phase is set by the D (Decay)
slider.

The S (Sustain) slider sets the level at which the envelope will remain from the end of the decay phase
to the release of the key. When this slider is set to 0, there is no sustain phase. With it set to 100, there
is no decay phase.

Finally, the release time is set with the R (Release) slider. This is the time it takes for the envelope to
reach zero after the key is released.

The Freq knob defines the center or cut-off frequency of the filter. The Res slider sets the resonance of
the filter frequency in LP, HP, and BP filters, and the width of the LP+HP filter.

28.2.4 Resonator Tabs

Collision’s Resonators.

The majority of Collision’s character is determined by the parameters in the two Resonator tabs. Each
resonator can be toggled on or off via the switch in its tab. Keep in mind that if both resonators are
turned off, no sound will be produced.

At the top of the Resonator tab, you will see a Resonance Type drop-down menu of resonant objects:

•
•

•
•

Beam simulates the resonance properties of beams of different materials and sizes.
Marimba, a specialized variant of the Beam model, reproduces the characteristic tuning of
marimba bar overtones which are produced as a result of the deep arch-cut of the bars.
String simulates the sound produced by strings of different materials and sizes.
Membrane is a model of a rectangular membrane (such as a drum head) with a variable size
and construction.
Plate simulates sound production by a rectangular plate (a flat surface) of different materials
and sizes.
Pipe simulates a cylindrical tube that is fully open at one end and has a variable opening at the
other (adjusted with the Opening parameter.)
Tube simulates a cylindrical tube that is closed at both ends.

Selecting an object adds a visualization of it to the X-Y Controller display.

Next to the Resonance Type drop-down is a Quality menu with options ranging from Eco to High.
Quality controls the trade-off between the sound quality of the resonators and CPU performance by
reducing the number of overtones that are calculated. Eco uses minimal CPU resources, while High
creates more sophisticated resonances. Note that the Pipe or Tube resonators do not offer a Quality
menu.

Each resonator contains a copy button (1 → 2 in Resonator 1 and 2 → 1 in Resonator 2) that you
can use to copy all the settings from one resonator to the other.

Using the X-Y Controller, you can click and drag the mouse horizontally to change the resonant
object’s decay time, or vertically to change the value of the Material/Radius parameter.

The decay time adjusts the amount of the internal damping in the resonator and can also be adjusted
using the Decay slider.

The Material slider adjusts the variation of damping at different frequencies. At lower values, low
frequency components decay slower than high frequency components (which simulates objects made
of wood, rubber, or nylon). At higher values, high frequency components decay slower (which
simulates objects made of glass or metal).

In the Pipe and Tube resonators, a Radius parameter is available in place of the Material parameter.
This slider adjusts the radius of the pipe or tube. As the radius increases, the decay time and high
frequency sustain both increase. At very large sizes, the fundamental pitch of the resonator also
changes.

The Decay and Material/Radius parameters can be modulated by note pitch and velocity via the Key
and Vel sliders in the MIDI tab.

An additional Ratio parameter is available for the Membrane and Plate resonators, which adjusts the
ratio of the object’s size along its x and y axes.

The Brightness control adjusts the amplitude of various frequency components. At higher values, higher
frequencies are louder. This parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.

The Inharm knob adjusts the pitch of the resonator’s harmonics. At negative values, frequencies are
compressed, increasing the number of lower partials. At positive values, frequencies are stretched,
increasing the number of upper partials. Inharm can also be modulated by velocity via the slider in
the MIDI tab. Note that this parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.

Opening, which is only available for the Pipe resonator, scales between an open and closed pipe. At
0%, the pipe is fully closed on one side, while at 100% the pipe is open at both ends. This parameter
can also be modulated by velocity in the MIDI tab.

The Hit slider adjusts the location on the resonator at which the object is struck or otherwise activated.
At 0%, the object is hit at its center. Higher values move the activation point closer to the edge. The Hit
position can also be randomized by increasing the value of the Rnd slider. Note that this parameter is
not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.

Note Off determines the extent to which MIDI Note Off messages mute the resonance. At 0%, Note
Offs are ignored, and the decay time is based only on the value of the Decay parameter. This is
similar to how real-world mallet instruments behave, such as marimbas and glockenspiels. At 100%,
the resonance is muted immediately at Note Off, regardless of the Decay time.

The Pos. L and Pos. R sliders adjust the location on the left and right resonator where the vibrations are
measured. At 0%, the resonance is monitored at the object’s center. Higher values move the listening
point closer to the edge. These parameters are not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators, which are
always measured in the middle of their permanently open end.

28.2.4.1 Tuning Section

Resonator Tuning Parameters.

The Tune knob and Fine slider function as coarse and fine tuning controls. Tune moves up or down in
semitone increments, while Fine adjusts in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of one quarter
tone (50 cents) up or down).

The Tune knob can also be modulated via the Key slider in the MIDI tab. The Key slider sets how much
the resonator’s tuning is adjusted by changes in MIDI note pitch. The default value of 100% means
that the resonator will conform to a conventional equal tempered scale. At 200%, each half step on
the keyboard will result in a whole step change in tuning. At negative values, the resonator will drop in
pitch as you play higher on the keyboard.

The Pitch Envelope parameters (Pitch Env and Time) apply a ramp that modulates the resonator’s pitch
over time. Pitch Env sets the starting pitch while Time adjusts how long it will take the pitch to glide to
its final value. The starting pitch can be modulated by velocity via the corresponding Vel slider in the
MIDI tab.

28.2.4.2 Mixer Section

Resonator Mixer.

Each resonator has its own Gain and Pan controls. Pan can also be modulated by note pitch via the
Key slider in the MIDI tab.

The Bleed control mixes a portion of the original oscillator signal with the resonated signal. At higher
values, more of the original signal is applied. This is useful for restoring high frequencies, which can
often be damped when the tuning or quality are set to low values.

Gain adjusts the output level of the selected resonator.
