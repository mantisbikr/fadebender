# 28.2.6.1 The Global Section

Collision’s Global Section.

The global section contains the parameters that relate to the overall behavior and performance of
Collision.

The Voices drop-down menu lets you set the maximum number of notes that can sound simultaneously.

When Retrig. is on, notes which are already playing will be retriggered, rather than generating an
additional voice. This can help to save CPU resources.

Structure determines the signal flow through the resonators.

In serial mode 1 > 2 both resonators output to Resonator 1. Resonator 1 is then mixed down to mono
and routed to Resonator 2, as well as its own mixer (in stereo).

Resonators in 1 > 2 (Serial) Configuration.

In parallel mode 1 + 2 the output from the Mallet and Noise sections is mixed and then sent directly to
both resonators.

Resonators in 1 + 2 (Parallel) Configuration.

Volume sets the overall volume output.
