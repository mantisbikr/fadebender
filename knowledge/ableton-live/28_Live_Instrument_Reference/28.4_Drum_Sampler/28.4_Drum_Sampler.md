# 28.4 Drum Sampler

The Drum Sampler Instrument.

Drum Sampler is an instrument designed for playing back one-shot samples in Drum Racks. It offers
key sampler features such as start and length controls, an AHD amplitude envelope, and pitch
controls. Drum Sampler also includes a filter section, modulation options, and a set of dedicated
playback effects for manipulating samples in various ways.

28.4.1 Sample Controls Section

Drum Sampler’s Sample Controls Section.

In the Sample Controls section, you can modify the sample’s envelope, pitch, and volume, as well as
swap out a loaded sample.

To load a sample into Drum Sampler, double-click a file in the browser or drag and drop it onto the
waveform display.

The Sample Start slider sets the point where sample playback begins, calculated as a percentage of
the sample’s length. Hold Shift while dragging the slider to adjust the start point in fine increments.

The Sample Length slider sets the length of the region that is played, calculated as a percentage of the
sample’s total length.

You can use the Sample Gain slider to adjust the volume of the sample, from -70 to 24 dB.

Adjusting the Sample Start, Sample Length, and Sample Gain controls also updates the waveform in
the display.

You can use the Attack, Hold, and Decay controls to adjust the sample’s envelope.

Attack sets the time needed to travel from the envelope’s initial level to its peak level.

Hold sets the time the envelope’s amplitude level remains at the peak level after reaching the attack
time. This parameter is disabled when the device’s Envelope Mode is set to Gate.

Decay sets the time needed to travel from the peak level back to zero after the Hold time is reached in
Trigger mode, or once the note is released in Gate mode.

The Transpose slider sets the global transposition amount, from -48 to 48 semitones, while the Detune
slider sets the global detune amount, from -50 to 50 cents.

Drum Sampler offers two envelope modes: Trigger and Gate. In Trigger mode, the sample continues
to play for the duration of the set Hold time after a note is released. In Gate mode, the sample fades
out according to the set Decay time once a note is released.

Hovering over the waveform display reveals additional controls for managing the loaded sample.

The Similar Sample Swapping and Hot-Swap Controls.

Use the Swap to Next Similar Sample button to cycle through samples that sound similar to the
original file. To go back through the options, click the Swap to Previous Similar Sample button. You
can also right-click the display and select Show Similar Files to access a list of similar samples in the
browser.

When cycling through samples, you can return to the initially loaded file by right-clicking the
waveform display and selecting Return to Reference. To set the currently loaded file as a new
reference for swapping, use the Save as Similarity Reference option.

The hot-swap button opens the Hot-Swap Browser, where you can replace the loaded sample with a
different one. To replace Drum Sampler with another instrument, use the hot-swap button in the
device’s title bar.

28.4.2 Playback Effects Section

Drum Sampler’s Playback Effects Section.

You can apply one of nine playback effects to further sculpt a sample’s sound: Stretch, Loop, Pitch Env,
Punch, 8-Bit, FM, Ring Mod, Sub Osc, and Noise.

Each playback effect has two parameters, which can be adjusted via dedicated knobs or by using the
X/Y pad. Drag vertically on the X/Y pad to adjust the first parameter, and drag horizontally to adjust
the second.

Use the Playback Effect On toggle to turn this section on or off. When enabled, you can select an
effect from the Playback Effect Type drop-down menu.

Stretch changes the sample’s length without altering its pitch. This produces granular artifacts, which
add lo-fi texture to the sound. The Factor control sets the amount of time-stretching as a multiple of the
original playback speed. The Grain Size control sets the size of the grain used to time-stretch the
sample in milliseconds.

Loop repeats a portion of the sample. The Loop Offset control sets the loop start point relative to the
sample start. The Loop Length control sets the loop’s duration in milliseconds.

Pitch Env uses an envelope to modulate the pitch of the sample over time. The Pitch Envelope Amount
control sets the amount of pitch modulation applied, from -100 to 100%. Positive values result in a
higher pitch, while negative values result in a lower pitch. The Pitch Envelope Decay control sets the
time it takes for the pitch to return to the base value as defined by the device’s global pitch controls.

Punch applies ducking with a fixed attack and an envelope shaped to emphasize the sample’s
transient. The Punch Amount control sets the amount of ducking applied. The Punch Release control
determines how long it takes for the gain reduction to return to zero after the initial trigger.

8-Bit applies a combination of filtering, bit reduction, and sample rate reduction to recreate the sound
of 8-bit CPU chips. The 8-Bit Sample Rate control sets the sample rate at which the sample is played
back. The 8-Bit Decay Time control sets the decay time of the effect’s built-in low-pass filter.

FM uses a sine wave to modulate the sample’s pitch. The Amount control sets the intensity of the
frequency modulation, while the FM Frequency control sets the frequency used to modulate the
sample’s pitch.

Ring Mod applies ring modulation to the sample. The Amount control sets how much modulation is
applied. The Ring Mod Frequency control sets the frequency used to modulate the sample’s amplitude.
Low values produce a tremolo effect, while high values produce artifacts that are typical of ring
modulation.

Sub Osc layers a sub oscillator with the sample. The Sub Oscillator Amount knob sets the oscillator’s
level. The oscillator envelope uses the device’s attack and decay settings. The Sub Oscillator
Frequency sets the oscillator’s frequency, from 30 to 120 Hz.

Noise Osc layers a noise oscillator with the sample. The Noise Amount knob sets the oscillator’s level.
The oscillator envelope uses the device’s attack and decay settings. The Noise Color control sets the
frequency used to filter the oscillator.

Note that time-based and frequency-related controls in the Stretch, Loop, FM, Ring Mod, Sub Osc,
and Noise Osc effects are influenced by the device’s global pitch controls and the MIDI note played.
This ensures that each effect’s pitch follows the pitch of the sample as different notes are played or
when the sample is transposed.

Additionally, the modulation decay of the FM and Ring Mod effects is affected by the global decay
time. For example, with short decay times, modulation is applied only to the sample’s transient.

28.4.3 Filter Section

Drum Sampler’s Filter Section.

Use the Filter On toggle to turn the filter on or off.

There are four filter types to choose from: a 12 dB low-pass filter, a 24 dB low-pass filter, a 24 dB
high-pass filter, and a peak filter.

The low and high-pass filters include dedicated Resonance and Filter Frequency controls. When the
peak filter is selected, you can use the Peak Filter Gain and Filter Frequency controls to boost or cut a
specific frequency range.

28.4.4 Global Section

Drum Sampler’s Global Section.

In the Global Section, you can adjust the output volume, panning, velocity-to-volume ratio, and
modulation parameters.

The Volume control sets the device’s global output level, from -36 to 36 dB, while the Pan slider
adjusts the stereo position.

The Velocity to Volume slider determines how much the device’s volume is modulated by incoming
MIDI note velocity.

Use the Modulation Source toggle to switch between two modulation sources: Velocity or Slide
(MPE). Then select a modulation target from the Modulation Destination drop-down menu.

The Filter target modulates the filter cutoff frequency.

You can modulate any of the individual envelope stages with the Attack, Hold, and Decay targets.

Use FX1 and FX2 to modulate the two parameters of the currently selected playback effect.

The Modulation Amount slider sets the amount of modulation that is applied to the target.

28.4.5 Context Menu Options for Drum Sampler

In addition to the usual device context menu entries, there are also a couple of options unique to Drum
Sampler.

Enable Per-Note Pitch Bend — This option allows Drum Sampler to receive per-note pitch bend
messages and is enabled by default.

Drum Sampler > Simpler — This replaces Drum Sampler with Simpler, retaining the sample’s start and
length positions.

When using Drum Racks, you can select the Save as Default Pad option from a pad’s context menu to
use Drum Sampler as the default for new samples.

The Save as Default Pad Option.

This means that each time a sample is added to an empty drum pad, an instance of Drum Sampler is
automatically loaded.

28.5 Electric

The Electric Instrument.

Electric is a software electric piano developed in collaboration with Applied Acoustics Systems. It is
based on the classic instruments of the seventies; each component has been modeled using cutting
edge physical modeling technology to provide realistic and lively sounds.

Physical modeling uses the laws of physics to reproduce the behavior of an object. In other words,
Electric solves, in real time, mathematical equations describing how its different components function.
No sampling or wavetables are used in Electric; the sound is calculated in real time by the CPU
according to the values of each parameter. Electric is more than a simple recreation of vintage
instruments; its parameters can be tweaked to values not possible with the real instruments to get some
truly amazing new sounds that still retain a warm acoustic quality.

28.5.1 Architecture and Interface

The mechanism of the electric piano is actually quite simple. A note played on the keyboard activates
a hammer that hits a fork. The sound of that fork is then amplified by a magnetic coil pickup and sent
to the output, very much like an electric guitar. The fork is made of two parts, called the tine bar and
tone bar. The tine bar is where the hammer hits the fork while the tone bar is a tuned metal resonator,
sized appropriately to produce the correct pitch. Once the fork is activated, it will continue to resonate
on its own for a long time. But releasing the key applies a damper to the fork, which mutes it more
quickly.

The Electric interface is divided into four main sections: Hammer, Fork, Damper/Pickup, which contain
parameters pertaining to the instrument’s tone and sound; and the Global section which contains
parameters that affect overall behavior and performance, such as pitch bend and polyphony.

You can click on the individual sections to reveal all of their associated parameters, or you can click
on the Hammer, Fork, or Damper/Pickup icons to toggle between those respective sections.

Electric’s Hammer, Fork, and Damper/Pickup Icons.

28.5.2 Hammer Section

Electric’s Hammer Section.

The Hammer section contains the parameters related to the physical properties of the hammer itself, as
well as how it’s affected by your playing.

The Stiffness knob adjusts the hardness of the hammer’s striking area. Higher values simulate a harder
surface, which results in a brighter sound. Lower values mean a softer surface and a more mellow
sound. Stiffness can also be modified by velocity and note pitch via the Vel and Key sliders in the
bottom half of the display.

The Noise knob adjusts the amount of impact noise caused by the hammer striking the fork. In the
Noise section in the bottom half of the display, the Pitch slider sets the center frequency of the noise
pitch, while the Decay slider adjusts how long it takes for the noise to fade to silence. The Key slider
controls how much the noise volume is determined by note pitch.

The Force section adjusts the intensity of the hammer’s impact on the fork. Low Amount values simulate
a soft impact while high values result in a hard impact. Force can also be modified by velocity and
note pitch, via the Vel and Key sliders.

28.5.3 Fork Section

Electric’s Fork Section.

The Fork section contains knobs for both Tine and Tone parameters, which are the heart of Electric’s
sound generating mechanism.

Tine controls the portion of the fork that is directly struck by the hammer.

The Color slider controls the relative amplitude of high and low partials in the tine’s spectrum. Low
values result in lower harmonics, while higher values result in higher harmonics.

The Decay knob adjusts how long it takes the tine’s sound to fade out while a note is held. The volume
level of the tine can be modulated by note pitch via the Key slider.

Tone controls the secondary resonance of the fork.

The Release slider applies to both Tine and Tone, and controls the decay time of the fork’s sound after
a key is released. The Decay parameter works in the same way as in the Tine subsection.

28.5.4 Damper/Pickup Section

Electric’s Damper/Pickup Section.

28.5.4.1 Pickup Parameters

In Electric, the Pickup simulates the behavior of the magnetic coil pickup that amplifies the sound of the
resonating fork.

The Symmetry knob and Distance slider adjust the physical location of the pickup in relation to the
tine. Symmetry simulates the vertical position of the pickup. At 50%, the pickup is directly in front of the
tine, which results in a brighter sound. Lower amounts move the pickup below the tine, while higher
amounts move it above the tine. Distance controls how far the pickup is from the tine. Higher amounts
increase the distance, while lower amounts move the pickup closer. Note that the sound becomes
more overdriven as the pickup approaches the tine.

The Type R and W buttons switch between two different types of pickups. In the R position, Electric
simulates electro-dynamic pickups, while W is based on an electro-static model.

The Input slider is used to adjust the amount of the fork’s signal that is fed to the pickup, which in turn
affects the amount of distortion applied to the overall signal. The Output slider controls the amount of
signal output by the pickup section. Different combinations of these two parameters can yield very
different results. For example, a low amount of input with a high amount of output will produce a
cleaner sound than a high input with a low output. The output level can be further modulated by note
pitch via the Key slider.

28.5.4.2 Damper Parameters

The metal forks in an electric piano are designed to sustain for a long time when a key is held. The
mechanism that regulates this sustain is called the damper. When a key is pressed, that note’s damper
is moved away from its fork. When the key is released, the damper is applied to the fork again to stop

it from vibrating. But the dampers themselves make a small amount of sound, both when they are
applied and when they are released. The Damper parameters simulate this characteristic noise.

The Tone slider adjusts the stiffness of the dampers. Lower values simulate soft dampers, which
produces a mellower sound. Higher values increase the hardness of the dampers, producing a
brighter sound. The overall amount of damper noise is adjusted with the Level slider.

The Att/Rel slider adjusts whether or not damper noise is present when the dampers are applied to the
fork or when they are released. At -100, damper noise will only be heard during the note’s attack
phase. At 100, the noise is present only during the release phase. In the center, an equal amount of
noise will be present during both attack and release.

28.5.5 Global Section

Electric’s Global Section.

The Global section contains the parameters that relate to the overall behavior and performance of
Electric.

The Volume knob sets Electric’s overall output level.

The Voices chooser sets the available polyphony. Since each voice that’s used requires additional
CPU, you may need to experiment with this setting to find a good balance between playability and
performance.

The Semi and Detune sliders function as coarse and fine tuners. Semi transposes the entire instrument
up or down in semitone increments, while the Detune slider adjusts in increments of one cent (up to a
maximum of 50 cents up or down).

Stretch simulates a technique known as stretch tuning, which is a common modification made to both
electric and acoustic pianos and is an intrinsic part of their characteristic sound. At 0%, Electric will
play in equal temperament, which means that two notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s
fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s. But because the actual resonance behavior of a

vibrating tine or string differs from the theoretical model, equal temperament tends to sound “wrong“
on pianos. Stretch tuning attempts to correct this by sharpening the pitch of upper notes while
flattening the pitch of lower ones. The result is a more brilliant sound. Negative values simulate
“negative“ stretch tuning; upper notes become flatter while lower notes become sharper.

Pitch Bend sets the range in semitones of global pitch bend modulation, while Note PB sets the MPE
per-note pitch bend range in semitones.
