# 28.4.4 Global Section

Drum Sampler’s Global Section.

In the Global Section, you can adjust the output volume, panning, velocity-to-volume ratio, and
modulation parameters.

The Volume control sets the device’s global output level, from -36 to 36 dB, while the Pan slider
adjusts the stereo position.

The Velocity to Volume slider determines how much the device’s volume is modulated by incoming
MIDI note velocity.

Use the Modulation Source toggle to switch between two modulation sources: Velocity or Slide
(MPE). Then select a modulation target from the Modulation Destination drop-down menu.

The Filter target modulates the filter cutoff frequency.

You can modulate any of the individual envelope stages with the Attack, Hold, and Decay targets.

Use FX1 and FX2 to modulate the two parameters of the currently selected playback effect.

The Modulation Amount slider sets the amount of modulation that is applied to the target.
