# 28.5.4.2 Damper Parameters

The metal forks in an electric piano are designed to sustain for a long time when a key is held. The
mechanism that regulates this sustain is called the damper. When a key is pressed, that note’s damper
is moved away from its fork. When the key is released, the damper is applied to the fork again to stop

it from vibrating. But the dampers themselves make a small amount of sound, both when they are
applied and when they are released. The Damper parameters simulate this characteristic noise.

The Tone slider adjusts the stiffness of the dampers. Lower values simulate soft dampers, which
produces a mellower sound. Higher values increase the hardness of the dampers, producing a
brighter sound. The overall amount of damper noise is adjusted with the Level slider.

The Att/Rel slider adjusts whether or not damper noise is present when the dampers are applied to the
fork or when they are released. At -100, damper noise will only be heard during the note’s attack
phase. At 100, the noise is present only during the release phase. In the center, an equal amount of
noise will be present during both attack and release.
