# 28.5.1 Architecture and Interface

The mechanism of the electric piano is actually quite simple. A note played on the keyboard activates
a hammer that hits a fork. The sound of that fork is then amplified by a magnetic coil pickup and sent
to the output, very much like an electric guitar. The fork is made of two parts, called the tine bar and
tone bar. The tine bar is where the hammer hits the fork while the tone bar is a tuned metal resonator,
sized appropriately to produce the correct pitch. Once the fork is activated, it will continue to resonate
on its own for a long time. But releasing the key applies a damper to the fork, which mutes it more
quickly.

The Electric interface is divided into four main sections: Hammer, Fork, Damper/Pickup, which contain
parameters pertaining to the instrument’s tone and sound; and the Global section which contains
parameters that affect overall behavior and performance, such as pitch bend and polyphony.

You can click on the individual sections to reveal all of their associated parameters, or you can click
on the Hammer, Fork, or Damper/Pickup icons to toggle between those respective sections.
