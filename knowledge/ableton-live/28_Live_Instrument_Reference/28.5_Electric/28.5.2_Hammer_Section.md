# 28.5.2 Hammer Section

Electric’s Hammer Section.

The Hammer section contains the parameters related to the physical properties of the hammer itself, as
well as how it’s affected by your playing.

The Stiffness knob adjusts the hardness of the hammer’s striking area. Higher values simulate a harder
surface, which results in a brighter sound. Lower values mean a softer surface and a more mellow
sound. Stiffness can also be modified by velocity and note pitch via the Vel and Key sliders in the
bottom half of the display.

The Noise knob adjusts the amount of impact noise caused by the hammer striking the fork. In the
Noise section in the bottom half of the display, the Pitch slider sets the center frequency of the noise
pitch, while the Decay slider adjusts how long it takes for the noise to fade to silence. The Key slider
controls how much the noise volume is determined by note pitch.

The Force section adjusts the intensity of the hammer’s impact on the fork. Low Amount values simulate
a soft impact while high values result in a hard impact. Force can also be modified by velocity and
note pitch, via the Vel and Key sliders.
