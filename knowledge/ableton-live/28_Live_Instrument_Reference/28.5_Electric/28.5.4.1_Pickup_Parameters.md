# 28.5.4.1 Pickup Parameters

In Electric, the Pickup simulates the behavior of the magnetic coil pickup that amplifies the sound of the
resonating fork.

The Symmetry knob and Distance slider adjust the physical location of the pickup in relation to the
tine. Symmetry simulates the vertical position of the pickup. At 50%, the pickup is directly in front of the
tine, which results in a brighter sound. Lower amounts move the pickup below the tine, while higher
amounts move it above the tine. Distance controls how far the pickup is from the tine. Higher amounts
increase the distance, while lower amounts move the pickup closer. Note that the sound becomes
more overdriven as the pickup approaches the tine.

The Type R and W buttons switch between two different types of pickups. In the R position, Electric
simulates electro-dynamic pickups, while W is based on an electro-static model.

The Input slider is used to adjust the amount of the fork’s signal that is fed to the pickup, which in turn
affects the amount of distortion applied to the overall signal. The Output slider controls the amount of
signal output by the pickup section. Different combinations of these two parameters can yield very
different results. For example, a low amount of input with a high amount of output will produce a
cleaner sound than a high input with a low output. The output level can be further modulated by note
pitch via the Key slider.
