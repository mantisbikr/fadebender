# 28.3.4.1 Envelope 1

Envelope 1 determines how the amplitude of the Oscillator section’s output (including both oscillators,
as well as the Noise generator if enabled) begins and changes when a note is played and then
released.

You can set the Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release controls using the respective knobs or by
adjusting the envelope itself in the display.

Attack sets the time needed to travel from the initial value to the peak value.

Decay sets the time needed to travel from the peak value to the Sustain level.

Sustain sets the level reached at the end of the Decay stage; the envelope will remain at this level until
the note ends.

Release sets the time needed to travel back to zero after the note is released.

You can toggle between Envelope 1 and Envelope 2 by clicking the respective section in the UI, or by
using the 1 and 2 toggles in the display. The selected envelope will be shown in the display for
editing.
