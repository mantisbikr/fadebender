# 28.3.5 LFO Section

Drift’s LFO Section.

Like the Cycling Envelope, Drift’s LFO can be set in one of four different time modes: Rate, Ratio, Time,
or Sync. The time mode determines the repetition rate of the LFO in Hz, ratio, milliseconds, or tempo-
synced beat divisions.

In the LFO display, you can select from nine different waveforms using the drop-down menu:

•

Sample & Hold
Wander is a sample and hold with an S-shape which interpolates between two values at the
rate of the LFO.
Linear Envelope is a one-shot decay envelope with a linear decay.
Exponential Envelope is a one-shot decay envelope with an exponential decay.

You can use the R switch to turn Retrigger on or off. If on, the LFO resets to the same position in its
phase each time a note is triggered. If off, the LFO is free-running.

The LFO Amount knob sets the overall intensity of the LFO. The LFO Modulation Source drop-down
menu lets you select a modulation source for the LFO, while the LFO Modulation Amount slider
determines how much that modulation is applied to the LFO.
