# 28.3.2.3 Pitch Mod

The Pitch Mod section contains two modulation source options, which will affect the pitch of both
oscillators. You can choose Env 1, Env 2 / Cyc, LFO, Key, Velocity, Modwheel, Pressure, or Slide as a
modulation source using the Oscillator Pitch Mod Source drop-down menus. The Oscillator Mod
Amount sliders determine how much each source modulates the pitch within a range from -100% to
100%.

When applying pitch modulation using an LFO that uses the Ratio time mode, it is possible to generate
FM tones.
