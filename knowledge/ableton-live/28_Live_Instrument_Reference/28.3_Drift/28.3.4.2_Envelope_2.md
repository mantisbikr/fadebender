# 28.3.4.2 Envelope 2

Envelope 2 also has Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release controls however, unlike Envelope 1,
Envelope 2 is not mapped to amplitude by default, and can be used as a source for all modulation
source options within Drift.

Envelope 2 can be changed from an ADSR envelope to a Cycling Envelope by toggling the switch to
the left of the Attack control.

Cycling Envelope.

The Cycling Envelope functions similarly to an LFO modulation that restarts with each incoming MIDI
note.

The Tilt knob moves the midpoint of the envelope, at very low or high amounts this can also affect the
envelope’s slopes. The Hold control defines how long the envelope stays at its maximum level.

By default, the Cycling Envelope displays the Rate control, which is one of four possible time modes,
also including Ratio, Time, or Sync. You can select the other modes by clicking the switches to the right
of the control. Depending on the time mode, the repetition rate can be set in Hz, ratio, milliseconds, or
tempo-synced beat divisions.
