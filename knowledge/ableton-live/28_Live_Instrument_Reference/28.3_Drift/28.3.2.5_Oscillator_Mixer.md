# 28.3.2.5 Oscillator Mixer

Drift’s Oscillator Mixer.

In Drift’s Oscillator Mixer, you can enable Oscillator 1 and 2, as well as a noise generator that adds
white noise to the overall waveform shape, by using the respective switches.

You can also set the gain for each oscillator and the noise generator with the Osc 1, Osc 2, and
Noise controls. When filter processing is on, high oscillator gain values can reach the maximum
“headroom” of the filters, at which point they stop functioning linearly, resulting in a complex distortion
similarly found in analog hardware.

There are two saturation points in the filter circuits that cause this distortion, one before the filter and
one after. As the oscillator gain values are increased from the default -6.0 dB, the first saturation point
will become activated, and the second will be triggered when gain values are above 0.0 dB.

Enabling the arrow toggles to the right of the gain controls switches on filter processing for the
oscillators and noise generator. If filter processing is switched off, the oscillator and noise generator
output bypasses the filter completely.

The R toggle switches Retrigger for the oscillators on or off. If Retrigger is on, the phase of both
oscillators is reset to the same position each time a note is played; if switched off, the oscillators are
free-running.
