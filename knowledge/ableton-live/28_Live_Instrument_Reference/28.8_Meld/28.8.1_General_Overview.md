# 28.8.1 General Overview

Meld’s dual-layer architecture can use up to two polyphonic synth engines at once. Its interface is
divided into four main sections: the engines, the modulation section, the filters, and the global mix
controls. This modular-inspired configuration makes it easy to add texture and movement to your
sounds, but also to produce and capture musical surprises. To get familiar with some of Meld’s
possibilities, try combining different waveform types and playing with each engine’s modulation

macros. For more control, try mapping an engine’s parameters to its Modulation Matrix, or
automating the device’s macro knobs using an LFO device. The more you experiment with the
interaction between Meld’s two layers, the more you’ll make the device your own.

Meld can be expanded using the Toggle Expanded View button in the device header. When in
expanded view, all possible modulation targets and sources will be shown. The A and B toggles can
be used to switch between each engine. Parameter modulation values can be copied from one
engine to another using the Copy to A and Copy to B buttons. Clicking the X button will erase all
active modulation values.
