# 28.8.6 Matrix Tab

Engine B’s Modulation Matrix.

Meld’s Modulation Matrix lets you assign modulation sources to modulation targets within the device.
For example, Engine A’s LFO 1 could be used to modulate its Volume, or Engine B’s Modulation
Envelope could be used to modulate its Filter Frequency.

Modulation sources are listed horizontally and modulation targets are listed vertically. Click and drag
a cell up or down to apply modulation between parameters. Negative values will make envelopes
and LFOs faster and positive values will make them slower. Note that some parameters have additive
modulation applied to them, while others have multiplicative modulation applied to them.

Click on a parameter to add it to the Modulation Matrix. Parameters are added to the Modulation
Matrix of the engine currently selected with the Display Selector Tab. If a parameter isn’t being
modulated, it will disappear from the Modulation Matrix when another parameter is clicked.
