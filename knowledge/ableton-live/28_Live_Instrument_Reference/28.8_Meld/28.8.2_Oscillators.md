# 28.8.2 Oscillators

Meld’s Oscillators.

Meld’s two engines can be turned on or off independently via switches in the Engines section.
Deactivating one of Meld’s engines will deactivate its associated filter in the device’s Filters section. A
filter can be turned on or off without affecting the activation of the engine it’s linked to.

Each of Meld’s engines has three pitch controls (Octaves, Semitones, and Cents). When the Use
Current Scale toggle is activated, the semitone indicator (st) switches to scale degrees (sd). You can
use these pitch controls to add harmonic depth to your sound, for example by transposing an engine
up an octave or a fifth, or by subtly detuning it in cents.

Engines A and B each have a selection of twenty-four oscillator types to choose from, including six
scale aware oscillators marked with a (♭♯). These range from simple sine wave generation oscillators
to layered wave swarms, complex frequency modulation, noise looping, and ambient sound

generation algorithms. Oscillator Types can be selected from an engine’s drop-down menu or cycled
through using the arrows in the Oscillator Types displays.
