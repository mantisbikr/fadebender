# 28.8.10 Mix Section

Mix Controls for Each Engine.

Each of Meld’s engines has Volume and Pan controls, as well as a dedicated Tone Filter that can be
found in Meld’s Mix section. The Volume control adjusts the overall output of an engine, and the Pan
control adjusts its position in the stereo field.

Meld’s Tone Filter control functions like a combined high and low-pass filter. When set to positive
values, it reduces an engine’s low frequencies. When set to negative values, it reduces an engine’s
high frequencies.

Meld’s built-in limiter can be activated by clicking the Limit button. When activated, the limiter is
applied per voice, after both engines have been mixed and the global Drive setting has been
applied. This is helpful for controlling Meld’s overall output level when both engines are in use.
