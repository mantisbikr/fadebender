# 28.8 Meld

The Meld Instrument.

Meld is a versatile synthesizer that combines two independent macro oscillator engines into one
device. While it can quickly dial in classic analog-style patches, Meld’s character shines through in
the array of synthesis and filtering techniques it lets you layer and experiment with. Each of the
device’s engines has a dedicated filter, envelopes, LFOs, and a MIDI and MPE-enabled Modulation
Matrix, as well as two oscillator-dependent macro knobs that control parameters ranging from simple
overtone modulation to more unusual features like noise loop fragmentation, chiptone pulsewidth, and
raindrop generation density. Meld is designed to produce expressive, unfamiliar sounds guided by
musical intention rather than technical detail.

28.8.1 General Overview

Meld’s dual-layer architecture can use up to two polyphonic synth engines at once. Its interface is
divided into four main sections: the engines, the modulation section, the filters, and the global mix
controls. This modular-inspired configuration makes it easy to add texture and movement to your
sounds, but also to produce and capture musical surprises. To get familiar with some of Meld’s
possibilities, try combining different waveform types and playing with each engine’s modulation

macros. For more control, try mapping an engine’s parameters to its Modulation Matrix, or
automating the device’s macro knobs using an LFO device. The more you experiment with the
interaction between Meld’s two layers, the more you’ll make the device your own.

Meld can be expanded using the Toggle Expanded View button in the device header. When in
expanded view, all possible modulation targets and sources will be shown. The A and B toggles can
be used to switch between each engine. Parameter modulation values can be copied from one
engine to another using the Copy to A and Copy to B buttons. Clicking the X button will erase all
active modulation values.

28.8.2 Oscillators

Meld’s Oscillators.

Meld’s two engines can be turned on or off independently via switches in the Engines section.
Deactivating one of Meld’s engines will deactivate its associated filter in the device’s Filters section. A
filter can be turned on or off without affecting the activation of the engine it’s linked to.

Each of Meld’s engines has three pitch controls (Octaves, Semitones, and Cents). When the Use
Current Scale toggle is activated, the semitone indicator (st) switches to scale degrees (sd). You can
use these pitch controls to add harmonic depth to your sound, for example by transposing an engine
up an octave or a fifth, or by subtly detuning it in cents.

Engines A and B each have a selection of twenty-four oscillator types to choose from, including six
scale aware oscillators marked with a (♭♯). These range from simple sine wave generation oscillators
to layered wave swarms, complex frequency modulation, noise looping, and ambient sound

generation algorithms. Oscillator Types can be selected from an engine’s drop-down menu or cycled
through using the arrows in the Oscillator Types displays.

28.8.3 Oscillator Macros

Meld’s Oscillator Macros.

Engines A and B each have two dedicated macro knobs, which change along with the oscillator type
selected. All four of the oscillator macro knobs can be assigned to a MIDI controller for live
performance or to the LFO device for automated modulation. They can also be modulated internally,
using the Modulation Matrix.

The Basic Shapes oscillator has two macro knobs, Shape and Tone. Shape morphs the oscillator’s
waveform between a sine, triangle, saw, and square wave. Tone changes the pulse width of the
source wave.

The Dual Basic Shapes oscillator has two macro knobs, Shape and Detune. Shape morphs the
oscillator’s waveform through sine, triangle, saw, and square wave shapes. Detune adds a copy of
this initial wave and detunes it.

The Noisy Shapes oscillator has two macro knobs, Shape and Rough. Shape morphs the oscillator’s
waveform through sine, triangle, saw, and square wave shapes. Rough adds noise distortion to this
source wave.

The Square Sync oscillator has two macro knobs, Freq 1 and Freq 2. These two controls change the
frequencies of the oscillator’s two synced square waves.

The Square 5th oscillator has two macro knobs, 5th Amt and P Width. 5th Amt morphs the oscillator’s
initial square wave to a second square wave that is a perfect fifth above it. P Width changes the pulse
width of the square wave being generated.

The Sub oscillator has two macro knobs, Tone and Aux. Tone morphs the oscillator’s initial sine wave
into a square wave. Aux adds a lower subharmonic sine wave to the initial sine wave being
generated.

The Swarm Sine, Swarm Triangle, Swarm Saw, and Swarm Square oscillators have two macro knobs,
Motion and Spacing. Motion adds modulation to the wave swarm being produced. Spacing fades
between increasingly complex chords as the amount applied is increased.

The Harmonic Fm oscillator has two macro knobs, Amount and Ratio, which change the modulation
amount and ratio in the frequency modulation algorithm.

The Fold Fm oscillator has two macro knobs, Amount and Shape. Amount changes the modulation
amount in the frequency modulation algorithm and Shape changes the shape of its carrier wave.

The Squelch oscillator has two macro knobs, Amount and Feedback. Amount changes the modulation
depth of the frequency modulation algorithm, and Feedback changes the amount of signal being fed
back into the device.

The Simple Fm oscillator has two macro knobs, Amount and Ratio, which change the modulation
amount and the depth in the frequency modulation algorithm, respectively.

The Chip oscillator has two macro knobs, Tone and Rate. Tone changes the oscillator’s pitch and pulse
width. Rate changes the speed of the chip interval being used.

The Shepard’s Pi oscillator has two macro knobs, Rate and Width. Rate changes the speed and
direction of the oscillator. Values 0.0 through 49.9 produce falling movements, and values 50.1
through 100.0 produce ascending movements. At 50.0, no movement is produced. Width changes
the number of octaves being used by the oscillator.

The Tarp oscillator has two macro knobs, Decay and Tone, which change the algorithm’s decay
amount and tonality.

The Extratone oscillator has two macro knobs, Pitch and Env Amount, which change the oscillator’s
pitch and envelope behavior.

The Noise Loop oscillator has two macro knobs, Rate and Fade. Rate sets the rate at which fragments
of different noise loops occur. At higher values, the oscillator produces noise. Fade dials in the grain
or roughness of the noise.

The Filtered Noise oscillator has two macro knobs, Freq and Width, which change the oscillator’s filter
frequency and width.

The Bitgrunge oscillator has two macro knobs, Freq and Mult. Freq adjusts the frequency of the square
wave being produced. Mult adjusts the number of sub-octaves being generated in relation to this
initial square wave. At its maximum setting, no sub-octaves are generated. At its minimum, a large
number of sub-octaves is generated.

The Crackle oscillator has two macro knobs, Density and Intensity. Density sets the average rate of
crackles being produced. Intensity adjusts the distribution of loudness and brightness within the
crackles.

The Rain oscillator has two macro knobs, Tone and Rate. Tone sets the resonance of the raindrop and
wind sounds being generated. This makes the oscillator tonal and dependent on the notes you play.
Rate sets the density of raindrop sounds being generated.

The Bubble oscillator has two macro knobs, Density and Spread. Density sets the rate of bubble
generation and Spread sets the randomness of the size of the bubbles being produced.

28.8.4 Envelopes Tab

Engine A’s Amplitude Envelope.

Each of Meld’s envelopes has Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release controls. These can be adjusted by
sliding the numerical values at the bottom of the Envelope section up or down, entering a value using
your computer keyboard, or clicking and dragging the breakpoints on the envelope’s graphical
display.

Attack, Decay, and Release Slope controls are marked in red, and can be adjusted by sliding the
numerical values at the bottom of the section, entering a value using your computer keyboard, or
clicking and dragging the diamonds between the breakpoints in the Envelope section’s graphical
displays.

Amplitude and Modulation envelopes have three Envelope Loop Modes. In Trigger mode, all
segments of the envelope play once a note is received, while the selected Sustain level is ignored. In
Loop mode, the entire envelope is looped without holding the selected Sustain level. In AD Loop
mode, only the Attack and Decay portions of the envelope are looped.

The Modulation envelope has one additional set of parameters: the Initial, Peak, and Final levels.
These parameters set the position of the envelope when it is triggered and released, which offers more
flexibility for modulation.

Initial and Final Parameters in Engine B’s Modulation Envelope.

Activating the Link Envelopes button links each engine’s Amplitude and Modulation envelopes. This is
useful for having Meld’s two engines function as a single instrument.

28.8.5 LFOs Tab

Engine A’s LFOs.

Each of Meld’s engines has two dedicated LFOs. The rates of LFO 1 and LFO 2 can be set in Hertz or
tempo-synced, and a Phase Offset slider offsets each LFO’s phase. When Retrigger is enabled, the
LFO restarts at the position set by the Phase Offset slider.

LFO 1’s waveform can be selected from the LFO 1 Type drop-down menu, which provides six
waveform types to choose from: Basic Shapes, Ramp, Wander, Alternate, Euclid, and Pulsate. These
waveforms can be further shaped using the LFO’s Rate knob and the two macro knobs adjacent to it,
which change depending on the waveform type selected.

LFO 1 can also be modulated in the LFO 1 FX panel. The FX1 and FX2 drop-down menus each have
seventeen effect types that can be serially applied to LFO 1. The degree of the effect applied can be
changed via its corresponding macro knob. Note that LFO 1 and LFO1 FX can be used as
independent modulation sources in Meld’s Modulation Matrix.

LFO 2 provides six classic waveform types to choose from: Sine, Tri, Saw Up, Saw Down, Rectangle,
Random S&H. LFO 2 can be used as a third independent modulation source in Meld’s Modulation
Matrix.

28.8.6 Matrix Tab

Engine B’s Modulation Matrix.

Meld’s Modulation Matrix lets you assign modulation sources to modulation targets within the device.
For example, Engine A’s LFO 1 could be used to modulate its Volume, or Engine B’s Modulation
Envelope could be used to modulate its Filter Frequency.

Modulation sources are listed horizontally and modulation targets are listed vertically. Click and drag
a cell up or down to apply modulation between parameters. Negative values will make envelopes
and LFOs faster and positive values will make them slower. Note that some parameters have additive
modulation applied to them, while others have multiplicative modulation applied to them.

Click on a parameter to add it to the Modulation Matrix. Parameters are added to the Modulation
Matrix of the engine currently selected with the Display Selector Tab. If a parameter isn’t being
modulated, it will disappear from the Modulation Matrix when another parameter is clicked.

28.8.7 MIDI and MPE Tabs

Engine A’s MIDI Tab.

Meld’s MIDI and MPE tabs let you use MIDI and MPE functionality as modulation sources, which can
transform Meld into a dynamic performance tool.

When Velocity is set as a modulation source, Meld will use an incoming MIDI note’s velocity value to
modulate its modulation target for the duration of that note.

When Pitch is set as a modulation source, Meld will use an incoming MIDI note’s pitch value to
modulate its modulation target for the duration of that note.

When Random is set as a modulation source, Meld will modulate its modulation target by a random
value, which is calculated each time a note is triggered.

Pitch Bend, Press, and Modulation Wheel are hardware controls found on many MIDI controller
devices. Note Pitch Bend, Slide, and Press are hardware controls found on many MPE controller
devices. If you don’t have a MIDI or MPE controller, you can still modulate these parameters using
clip envelopes.

28.8.8 Settings Tab

Meld’s Engine Settings.

Meld’s Settings tab has three global settings that can be applied per engine: Osc Key Tracking, Scale
Awareness, and Glide.

The Osc Key Tracking switch activates or deactivates oscillator key tracking. When activated, an
oscillator will play the pitch of whatever incoming MIDI note it receives. When deactivated, an

oscillator will play a constant pitch of C3 for all incoming MIDI notes, or the root of a scale in the C3
octave if Scale Mode has been activated. This is useful for performing drones or percussive sounds,
for example.

Enabling the Phase Reset switch resets the phase of the oscillator to a consistent value with each new
note. The Phase Spread switch also becomes accessible when Phase Reset is enabled. When Phase
Spread is activated, the oscillator’s start phase is spread based on the Spread modulation source in
the Modulation Matrix. When Phase Spread is deactivated, the start phase is set to zero.

Two switches can be activated in the Scale Awareness section: Oscillator Scale Awareness and Filter
Scale Awareness.

When Oscillator Scale Awareness is activated, pitches controlled by scale-aware oscillator types will
also be in scale. The following oscillator types, marked with a (♭♯), are scale aware: Dual Basic
Shapes, Swarm Sine, Swarm Triangle, Swarm Saw, Swarm Square, and Chip.

When Filter Scale Awareness is enabled, the resonating frequencies of scale-aware filter types will
also be in scale. The following filter types, marked with a (♭♯), are scale aware: Plate Resonator and
Membrane Resonator.

The Glide section has two glide modes, Portamento (Porta) and Glissando (Gliss), as well as a Glide
Time control.

The Glide Time control sets the time that overlapping notes take to slide into the next incoming pitch.
Glide is active in both Mono and Poly modes.

When Portamento is activated and a note is played while another is held down, the first note’s pitch
will slide progressively into the second note’s pitch. When Glissando is activated and a note is played
while another is held down, the first note’s pitch will ascend or descend into the second note’s pitch in
discrete steps. Glissando produces these steps in scale degrees if scale awareness is enabled. Note
that portamento and glissando effects are only audible when Glide Time is set to a value above zero.

28.8.9 Filters

Meld’s Filters Section.

Meld’s two engines each have a dedicated filter, A and B, which can be turned on or off
independently via switches in the Filters section.

The Filter Frequency knob sets the center of the filter’s cutoff frequency.

The Filter Type drop-down menu lets you choose from seventeen different filter types. Each filter has
two macro knobs, which change with the filter type selected.

The most common filter macro knobs in Meld are Q and Drive. Q adjusts the emphasis of the
frequencies around a filter’s cutoff frequency. Drive applies saturation to the input signal before it
passes through the filter, which is useful for producing distortion.

The SVF 12dB and 24dB filters are state variable filters. The L-B-H-N macro control morphs through
this filter type’s four possible configurations: low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, and notch.

The MS2 filters are modeled on a Sallen-Key design from a famous semi-modular Japanese
monosynth, which applies soft clipping to limit resonance. They are available in low-pass and high-
pass configurations in Meld.

The OSR filter is modeled on a state variable filter from a rare British monosynth whose resonance is
limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. It is available in a band-pass configuration in Meld.

LP Crunch 12dB is a dual-mode low-pass filter that feeds the distortion it produces back into itself.

The LP Switched Res filter is modeled on low-pass filters whose resistors are replaced with fast switches
to produce downsampling artifacts. The Lofi macro knob changes the frequency of the filter’s resistors.
If set to a high value, the filter produces a more crushed sound. If set to a low value, it produces a
smoother sound.

Filther is modeled on a low-pass filter that applies distortion to a signal’s input and output. It uses a
hard diode clipper on the input signal and soft saturation on the output signal.

The Eq Peak and Eq Notch filters are peak and notch filters that apply gain and width to an input
signal. The Eq Peak filter’s Boost macro knob boosts frequencies around the filter’s cutoff point. The Eq
Notch filter’s Cut macro knob cuts frequencies around the filter’s cutoff point.

The Phaser filter is a six-stage delayless inverted feedback phaser with variable feedback and notch
spacing. The Phaser filter’s Feedback macro knob sets the amount of output being fed back into the
filter’s input. The Spread macro knob adjusts the spacing between the filter’s notches in the frequency
spectrum.

The Redux filter is a resampler and bitcrusher with a variable sample rate, quantization, and knob
over the amount of resampling artifacts it produces. The Crush macro knob sets the bit depth of the
filter’s output. The Lofi macro knob adjusts the mix between a filtered, sample rate-reduced version of
the signal and the unfiltered, downsampled artifacts Redux has produced.

The Vowel filter is a formant filter that mimics the characteristics of vowels being pronounced, with
various configurations that can be morphed through using the filter’s Morph macro knob.

The Comb + and Comb - filters are feedforward and feedback filters. The Feedback macro knob
adjusts the amount of feedforward or feedback being sent from the filter’s delayed output back into its
input. The Damp knob applies a low-pass filter to the filter’s output, to damp high frequencies.

The Plate Resonator filter applies a set of modal resonators tuned to the first 32 modes of a
rectangular plate to the input signal. The plate’s size, resonance, and dimension ratio can be modified

using its macro knobs. When Filter Scale Awareness is enabled, this filter’s resonating frequencies will
be in scale.

The Membrane Resonator filter applies a set of modal resonators tuned to the first 32 modes of a
circular membrane to the input signal. The membrane’s size, resonance, and high frequency damping
can be modified using its macro knobs. When Filter Scale Awareness is enabled, this filter’s resonating
frequencies will be in scale.

28.8.10 Mix Section

Mix Controls for Each Engine.

Each of Meld’s engines has Volume and Pan controls, as well as a dedicated Tone Filter that can be
found in Meld’s Mix section. The Volume control adjusts the overall output of an engine, and the Pan
control adjusts its position in the stereo field.

Meld’s Tone Filter control functions like a combined high and low-pass filter. When set to positive
values, it reduces an engine’s low frequencies. When set to negative values, it reduces an engine’s
high frequencies.

Meld’s built-in limiter can be activated by clicking the Limit button. When activated, the limiter is
applied per voice, after both engines have been mixed and the global Drive setting has been
applied. This is helpful for controlling Meld’s overall output level when both engines are in use.

28.8.11 Global Controls

Meld’s Global Parameters.

Meld’s global controls affect the overall sound and behavior of the instrument.

Meld’s Mono/Poly switch toggles between a monophonic and polyphonic output.

When Mono is activated, the Legato switch can be toggled on or off. When Legato is activated, if a
new note is played while another is held, the new note will use the original note’s envelope from its

current position. When Legato is deactivated, each new note played will trigger its own envelope
from the beginning.

When Poly is activated, a drop-down menu lets you set the number of voices usable by Meld, from 2
to 12.

The Spread control adjusts the range of the Spread modulation source in Meld’s Modulation Matrix.
When a voice number is set in the Stacked Voices control, Spread produces an offset between each
stacked voice. When Stacked Voices is set to Off, Spread produces a range of different values for
each note in a held chord. Note that Spread will have no effect if not applied to a modulation target
in the Modulation Matrix.

The Stacked Voices drop-down menu adjusts the number of stacked voices for a single note. Stacked
voices duplicate both engines for each note (including filters, modulation, and mixer settings), and
can create a heavy CPU load.

The Mixer Drive control sets the amount of saturation applied to Meld’s output. Drive is applied per
voice, after mixer settings, and before the limiter.

The Volume control adjusts Meld’s output volume.

The Use Current Scale button makes Meld follow Live’s Scale Mode. When activated, Meld’s
oscillators follow Live’s current scale, with all transpositions (including the Pitch Quant modulation
target in the Modulation Matrix) occurring in scale degrees rather than semitones.
