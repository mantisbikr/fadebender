# 28.8.7 MIDI and MPE Tabs

Engine A’s MIDI Tab.

Meld’s MIDI and MPE tabs let you use MIDI and MPE functionality as modulation sources, which can
transform Meld into a dynamic performance tool.

When Velocity is set as a modulation source, Meld will use an incoming MIDI note’s velocity value to
modulate its modulation target for the duration of that note.

When Pitch is set as a modulation source, Meld will use an incoming MIDI note’s pitch value to
modulate its modulation target for the duration of that note.

When Random is set as a modulation source, Meld will modulate its modulation target by a random
value, which is calculated each time a note is triggered.

Pitch Bend, Press, and Modulation Wheel are hardware controls found on many MIDI controller
devices. Note Pitch Bend, Slide, and Press are hardware controls found on many MPE controller
devices. If you don’t have a MIDI or MPE controller, you can still modulate these parameters using
clip envelopes.
