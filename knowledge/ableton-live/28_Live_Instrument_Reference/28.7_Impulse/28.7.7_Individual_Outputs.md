# 28.7.7 Individual Outputs

When a new instance of Impulse is dragged into a track, its signal will be mixed with those of the other
instruments and effects feeding the audio chain of the track. It can oftentimes make more sense to
isolate the instrument or one of its individual drum samples, and send this signal to a separate track.
Please see the Routing and I/O chapter to learn how to accomplish this for Impulse’s overall signal or
for Impulse’s individual sample slots.
