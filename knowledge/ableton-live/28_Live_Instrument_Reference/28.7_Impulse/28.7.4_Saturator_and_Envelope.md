# 28.7.4 Saturator and Envelope

The Saturator gives the sample a fatter, rounder, more analog sound, and can be switched on and off
as desired. The Drive control boosts the signal and adds distortion. Coincidentally, this makes most
signals much louder, and should usually be compensated for by lowering the sample’s volume
control. Extreme Drive settings on low-pitched sounds will produce the typical, overdriven analog
synth drum sounds.

The envelope can be adjusted using the Decay control, which can be set to a maximum of 10.0
seconds. Impulse has two decay modes: Trigger Mode allows the sample to decay with the note;
Gate Mode forces the envelope to wait for a Note Off message before beginning the decay. This
mode is useful in situations where you need variable decay lengths, as is the case with hi-hat cymbal
sounds.
