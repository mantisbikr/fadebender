# 28.7.3 Filter

The Filter section offers a broad range of filter types, each of which can impart different sonic
characteristics onto the sample by removing certain frequencies. The Frequency control defines where
in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; the Resonance control boosts frequencies near that
point. Filter Frequency can be modulated by either a random value or by MIDI note velocity.
