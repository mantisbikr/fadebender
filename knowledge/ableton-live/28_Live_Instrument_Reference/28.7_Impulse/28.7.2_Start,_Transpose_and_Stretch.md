# 28.7.2 Start, Transpose and Stretch

The Start control defines where Impulse begins playing a sample, and can be set up to 100 ms later
than the actual sample beginning. The Transp (Transpose) control adjusts the transposition of the
sample by +/- 48 semitones, and can be modulated by incoming note velocity or a random value, as
set in the appropriate fields.

The Stretch control has values from -100 to 100 percent. Negative values will shorten the sample, and
positive values will stretch it. Two different stretching algorithms are available: Mode A is ideal for low
sounds, such as toms or bass, while Mode B is better for high sounds, such as cymbals. The Stretch
value can also be modulated by MIDI note velocity.
