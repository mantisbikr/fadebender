# 28.7.5 Pan and Volume

Each sample has Volume and Pan controls that adjust amplitude and stereo positioning, respectively.
Both controls can be modulated: Pan by velocity and a random value, and Volume by velocity only.

28.7.6 Global Controls

The parameters located to the right of the sample slots are global controls that apply to all samples
within Impulse’s domain. Volume adjusts the overall level of the instrument, and Transp adjusts the
transposition of all samples. The Time control governs the time-stretching and decay of all samples,
allowing you to morph between short and stretched drum sounds.
