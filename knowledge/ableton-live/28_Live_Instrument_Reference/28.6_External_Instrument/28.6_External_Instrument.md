# 28.6 External Instrument

The External Instrument.

The External Instrument device is not an instrument itself, but rather a routing utility that allows you to
easily integrate external (hardware) synthesizers and multitimbral plug-ins into your projects. It sends
MIDI out and returns audio.

The two MIDI To choosers select the output to which the device will send MIDI data. The top chooser
selects either a physical MIDI port, or a multitimbral plug-in. If you select a MIDI port (for use with an
external synthesizer), the second chooser’s options will be MIDI channel numbers.

If another track in your Set contains a multitimbral plug-in, you can select this track in the top chooser.
In this case, the second chooser allows you to select a specific MIDI channel in the plug-in.

The Audio From chooser provides options for returning the audio from the hardware synth or plug-in
device. If you’re routing to a hardware synth, use this chooser to select the ports on your audio

interface that are connected to the output of your synth. The available choices you’ll have will depend
on the settings in the Audio Settings.

If you’re routing to a multitimbral plug-in on another track in your Live Set, the Audio From chooser will
list the auxiliary outputs in the plug-in. Note that the main outputs will be heard on the track that
contains the instrument.

The Gain knob adjusts the audio level coming back from the sound source. This level should be set
carefully to avoid clipping.

Since external devices can introduce latency that Live cannot automatically detect, you can manually
compensate for any delays by adjusting the Hardware Latency slider. The button next to this slider
allows you to set your latency compensation amount in either milliseconds or samples. If your external
device connects to Live via a digital connection, you will want to adjust your latency settings in
samples, which ensures that the number of samples you specify will be retained even when changing
the sample rate. If your external device connects to Live via an analog connection, you will want to
adjust your latency settings in milliseconds, which ensures that the amount of time you specify will be
retained when changing the sample rate. Note that adjusting in samples gives you finer control, so
even in cases when you’re working with analog devices, you may want to “fine tune“ your latency in
samples in order to achieve the lowest possible latency. In this case, be sure to switch back to
milliseconds before changing your sample rate. Any latency introduced by devices within Live will be
compensated for automatically, so the slider will be disabled when using the External Instrument
Device to route internally.

Note: If the Delay Compensation option is unchecked in the Options menu, the Hardware Latency
slider is disabled.

For more detailed information about routing scenarios with the External Instrument device, please see
the Routing and I/O chapter.

28.7 Impulse

The Impulse Instrument.

Impulse is a drum sampler with complex modulation capabilities. The eight drum samples loaded into
Impulse’s sample slots can be time-stretched, filtered and processed by envelope, saturation, pan and
volume components, nearly all of which are subject to random and velocity-based modulation.

28.7.1 Sample Slots

Drag and drop samples into any of Impulse’s sample slots from the browser or the Session and
Arrangement Views. Alternatively, each sample slot features a Hot-Swap button for hot-swapping
samples. Loaded samples can be deleted using the Backspace (Win) or Delete (Mac) key.

Imported samples are automatically mapped onto your MIDI keyboard, providing that it is plugged in
and acknowledged by Live. C3 on the keyboard will trigger the leftmost sample, and the other
samples will follow suit in the octave from C3 to C4. Impulse’s eight slots will appear labeled in the
MIDI Editor’s key tracks when the Fold button is active, even if the given key track is void of MIDI
notes. Mapping can be transposed from the default by applying a Pitch device, or it can be
rearranged by applying a Scale device.

Each of the eight samples has a proprietary set of parameters, located in the area below the sample
slots and visible when the sample is clicked. Adjustments to sample settings are only captured once
you hit a new note — they do not affect currently playing notes. Note that this behavior also defines
how Impulse reacts to parameter changes from clip envelopes or automation, which are applied once
a new note starts. If you want to achieve continuous changes as a note plays, you may want to use
the Simpler instrument.

Slot 8’s parameters also include a Link button, located in the lower left corner, which links slot 8 with
slot 7. Linking the two slots allows slot 7’s activation to stop slot 8’s playback, and vice versa. This was
designed with a specific situation in mind (but can, of course, be used for other purposes): Replicating
the way that closed hi-hats will silence open hi-hats.

Each slot can be played, soloed, muted or hot-swapped using controls that appear when the mouse
hovers over it.

28.7.2 Start, Transpose and Stretch

The Start control defines where Impulse begins playing a sample, and can be set up to 100 ms later
than the actual sample beginning. The Transp (Transpose) control adjusts the transposition of the
sample by +/- 48 semitones, and can be modulated by incoming note velocity or a random value, as
set in the appropriate fields.

The Stretch control has values from -100 to 100 percent. Negative values will shorten the sample, and
positive values will stretch it. Two different stretching algorithms are available: Mode A is ideal for low
sounds, such as toms or bass, while Mode B is better for high sounds, such as cymbals. The Stretch
value can also be modulated by MIDI note velocity.

28.7.3 Filter

The Filter section offers a broad range of filter types, each of which can impart different sonic
characteristics onto the sample by removing certain frequencies. The Frequency control defines where
in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; the Resonance control boosts frequencies near that
point. Filter Frequency can be modulated by either a random value or by MIDI note velocity.

28.7.4 Saturator and Envelope

The Saturator gives the sample a fatter, rounder, more analog sound, and can be switched on and off
as desired. The Drive control boosts the signal and adds distortion. Coincidentally, this makes most
signals much louder, and should usually be compensated for by lowering the sample’s volume
control. Extreme Drive settings on low-pitched sounds will produce the typical, overdriven analog
synth drum sounds.

The envelope can be adjusted using the Decay control, which can be set to a maximum of 10.0
seconds. Impulse has two decay modes: Trigger Mode allows the sample to decay with the note;
Gate Mode forces the envelope to wait for a Note Off message before beginning the decay. This
mode is useful in situations where you need variable decay lengths, as is the case with hi-hat cymbal
sounds.

28.7.5 Pan and Volume

Each sample has Volume and Pan controls that adjust amplitude and stereo positioning, respectively.
Both controls can be modulated: Pan by velocity and a random value, and Volume by velocity only.

28.7.6 Global Controls

The parameters located to the right of the sample slots are global controls that apply to all samples
within Impulse’s domain. Volume adjusts the overall level of the instrument, and Transp adjusts the
transposition of all samples. The Time control governs the time-stretching and decay of all samples,
allowing you to morph between short and stretched drum sounds.

28.7.7 Individual Outputs

When a new instance of Impulse is dragged into a track, its signal will be mixed with those of the other
instruments and effects feeding the audio chain of the track. It can oftentimes make more sense to
isolate the instrument or one of its individual drum samples, and send this signal to a separate track.
Please see the Routing and I/O chapter to learn how to accomplish this for Impulse’s overall signal or
for Impulse’s individual sample slots.
