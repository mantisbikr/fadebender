# 28.9 Operator

The Operator Instrument.

Operator is an advanced and flexible synthesizer that combines the concept of “frequency
modulation“ (FM) with classic subtractive and additive synthesis. It uses four multi-waveform
oscillators that can modulate each other’s frequencies, creating very complex timbres from a limited
number of objects. Operator includes a filter section, an LFO and global controls, as well as individual
envelopes for the oscillators, filter, LFO and pitch.

28.9.1 General Overview

The interface of Operator consists of two parts: the display surrounded on either side by the shell. The
shell offers the most important parameters in a single view and is divided into eight sections. On the
left side, you will find four oscillator sections, and on the right side from top to bottom, the LFO, the
filter section, the pitch section and the global parameters. If you change one of the shell parameters,
the display in the center will automatically show the details of the relevant section. When creating your
own sounds, for example, you can conveniently access the level and frequency of all oscillators at
once via the shell, and then adjust each individual oscillator’s envelope, waveform and other
parameters in its display.

Operator can be folded with the triangular button at its upper left. This is convenient if you do not
need to access the display details.

Operator Folded.

Each of Operator’s oscillators can either output its signal directly or use its signal to modulate another
oscillator. Operator offers eleven predefined algorithms that determine how the oscillators are
connected. An algorithm is chosen by clicking on one of the structure icons in the global display,
which will appear if the bottom right (global) section of the shell is selected. Signals will flow from top
to bottom between the oscillators shown in an algorithm icon. The algorithm selector can be mapped
to a MIDI controller, automated, or modulated in real time, just like any other parameter.

Operator’s Algorithms.

Typically, FM synthesis makes use of pure sine waves, creating more complex waveforms via
modulation. However, in order to simplify sound design and to create a wider range of possible
sounds, we designed Operator to produce a variety of other waveforms, including two types of noise.

You can also draw your own waveforms via a partial editor. The instrument is made complete with an
LFO, a pitch envelope and a filter section. Note that lots of “classic“ FM synthesizers create fantastic
sounds without using filters at all, so we suggest exploring the possibilities of FM without the filter at
first, and adding it later if necessary.

Operator will keep you busy if you want to dive deep into sound design! If you want to break the
universe apart completely and reassemble it, you should also try modulating Operator’s controls with
clip envelopes or track automation.

28.9.2 Oscillator Section

Oscillator A’s Display and Shell Parameters.

28.9.2.1 Built-in Waveforms

The oscillators come with a built-in collection of basic waveform types — sine, sawtooth, square,
triangle and noise — which are selected from the Wave chooser in the individual oscillator displays.
The first of these waveforms is a pure, mathematical sine wave, which is usually the first choice for
many FM timbres. We also added “Sine 4 Bit“ and “Sine 8 Bit“ to provide the retro sound adored by
C64 fans, and “Saw D“ and “Square D“ digital waveforms, which are especially good for digital
bass sounds. The square, triangle and sawtooth waveforms are resynthesized approximations of the
ideal shape. The numbers included in the displayed name (e.g., “Square 6“) define how many
harmonics are used for the resynthesis. Lower numbers sound mellower and are less likely to create
aliasing when used on high pitches. There are also two built-in noise waveforms. The first, “Noise
Looped,“ is a looping sample of noise. For truly random noise, choose “Noise White.“

28.9.2.2 User Waveforms

The “User“ entry in the Wave chooser allows you to create your own waveforms by drawing the
amplitudes of the oscillator’s harmonics. You can also select one of the built-in waveforms and then
edit it in the same way. The small display next to the Wave chooser gives a real-time overview of your
waveform.

When your mouse is over the Oscillator display area, the cursor will change to a pencil. Drawing in
the display area then raises or lowers the amplitudes of the harmonics. As you adjust the amplitudes,
the Status Bar will show the number of the harmonic you’re adjusting as well as its amplitude. Holding

Shift and dragging will constrain horizontal mouse movement, allowing you to adjust the
amplitude of only one harmonic at a time.

You can switch between editing the first 16, 32 or 64 harmonics via the switches to the right of the
display. Higher harmonics can be generated by repeating the drawn partials with a gradual fadeout,
based on the settings in the Repeat chooser. Low Repeat values result in a brighter sound, while higher
values result in more high-end roll-off and a more prominent fundamental. With Repeat off, partials
above the 16th, 32nd or 64th harmonic are truncated.

The context menu in the harmonics display offers options for editing only the even or odd harmonics.
This is set to “All“ by default. The context menu also offers an option to toggle Normalize on or off.
When enabled, the oscillator’s overall output level is maintained as you draw additional harmonics.
When disabled, additional harmonics add additional level. Note that the volume can become
extremely loud if Normalize is off.

You can export your waveform in .ams format to the Samples/Waveforms folder in your User Library
via an option in the context menu. Ams files can be imported back into Operator by dragging them
from the browser onto one of the oscillator’s display areas. Ams files can also be loaded into Simpler
or Sampler.

Both the built-in and user waveforms can be copied and pasted from one oscillator to another using
the Osc Preview’s context menu.

28.9.2.3 More Oscillator Parameters

The frequency of an oscillator can be adjusted in the shell with its Coarse and Fine controls. An
oscillator’s frequency usually follows that of played notes, but for some sounds it might be useful to set
one or more oscillators to fixed frequencies. This can be done for each individual oscillator by
activating the Fixed option. This allows the creation of sounds in which only the timbre will vary when
different notes are played, but the tuning will stay the same. Fixed Mode would be useful, for
example, in creating live drum sounds. Fixed Mode also allows producing very low frequencies down
to 0.1 Hz. Note that when Fixed Mode is active, the frequency of the oscillator is controlled in the shell
with the Frequency (Freq) and Multiplier (Multi) controls.

Operator includes a special Osc < Vel control for each oscillator that allows altering frequency as a
function of velocity. This feature can be very useful when working with sequenced sounds in which the
velocity of each note can be adjusted carefully. Part of this functionality is the adjacent Q (Quantize)
button. If this control is activated, the frequency will only move in whole numbers, just as if the Coarse
control were being manually adjusted. If quantize is not activated, the frequency will be shifted in an
unquantized manner, leading to detuned or inharmonic sounds (which very well could be exactly
what you want…).

The amplitude of an oscillator depends on the Level setting of the oscillator in the shell and on its
envelope, which is shown and edited when the Envelope display is visible. The envelopes can also be
modified by note velocity and note pitch with the Vel and Key parameters available in the Envelope
section of each oscillator’s display.

The phase of each oscillator can be adjusted using the Phase control in its display. With the R
(Retrigger) button enabled, the waveform restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is
triggered. With R disabled, the oscillator is free-running.

As explained earlier oscillators can modulate each other when set up to do so with the global
display’s algorithms. When an oscillator is modulating another oscillator, two main properties define
the result: the amplitude of the modulating oscillator and the frequency ratio between both oscillators.
Any oscillator that is not modulated by another oscillator can modulate itself, via the Feedback
parameter in its display.

28.9.2.4 Aliasing

Aliasing distortion is a common side effect of all digital synthesis and is the result of the finite sample
rate and precision of digital systems. It mostly occurs at high frequencies. FM synthesis is especially
likely to produce this kind of effect, since one can easily create sounds with lots of high harmonics. This
also means that more complex oscillator waveforms, such as “Saw 32,“ tend to be more sensitive to
aliasing than pure sine waves. Aliasing is a two-fold beast: A bit of it can be exactly what is needed
to create a cool sound, yet a bit too much can make the timbre unplayable, as the perception of pitch
is lost when high notes suddenly fold back into arbitrary pitches. Operator minimizes aliasing by
working in a high-quality Antialias mode. This is on by default for new patches, but can be turned off
in the global section. The Tone parameter in the global section also allows for controlling aliasing. Its
effect is sometimes similar to a low-pass filter, but this depends on the nature of the sound itself and
cannot generally be predicted. If you want to familiarize yourself with the sound of aliasing, turn Tone
up fully and play a few very high notes. You will most likely notice that some notes sound completely
different from other notes. Now, turn Tone down and the effect will be reduced, but the sound will be
less bright.

28.9.3 LFO Section

Operator’s LFO Display and Shell Parameters.

The LFO in Operator can practically be thought of as a fifth oscillator. It runs at audio rates, and it
modulates the frequency of the other oscillators. It is possible to switch LFO modulation on or off for
each individual oscillator (and the filter) using the Dest. A buttons in the LFO’s display. The intensity of
the LFO’s modulation of these targets can be adjusted by the Dest. A slider. The LFO can also be
turned off entirely if it is unused.

The Dest. B chooser allows the LFO to modulate an additional parameter. The intensity of this
modulation is determined by the Dest. B slider.

The LFO offers a choice of classic LFO waveforms, sample and hold (S&H), and noise. Sample and
hold uses random numbers chosen at the rate of the LFO, creating the random steps useful for typical
retro-futuristic sci-fi sounds. The noise waveform is simply band-pass filtered noise.

Tip: FM synthesis can be used to create fantastic percussion sounds, and using the LFO with the noise
waveform is the key to great hi-hats and snares.

The frequency of the LFO is determined by the LFO Rate control in the shell, as well as the low/high/
sync setting of the adjacent LFO Range chooser. The frequency of the LFO can follow note pitch, be
fixed or be set to something in between. This is defined by the Rate < Key parameter in the LFO’s
display. With the R (Retrigger) button enabled, the LFO restarts at the same position in its phase each
time a note is triggered. With R disabled, the LFO is free-running.

The overall intensity of the LFO is set by the LFO Amount control in the shell. This parameter scales both
the Dest. A and B amounts and can be modulated by note velocity via the display’s Amt < Vel control.
The LFO’s intensity is also affected by its envelope.

28.9.4 Envelopes

Operator’s Oscillator B Envelope.

Operator has seven envelopes: one for each oscillator, a filter envelope, a pitch envelope and an
envelope for the LFO. All envelopes feature some special looping modes. Additionally, the filter and
pitch envelopes have adjustable slopes.

Each oscillator’s volume envelope is defined by six parameters: three rates and three levels. A rate is
the time it takes to go from one level to the next. For instance, a typical pad sound starts with the initial
level “-inf dB“ (which is silence), moves with an attack rate to its peak level, moves from there to the
sustain level with a decay rate, and then finally, after Note Off occurs, back to “-inf dB“ at the release
rate. Operator’s display provides a good overview of the actual shape of any particular envelope
and lets you directly adjust the curve by clicking on a breakpoint and dragging. The breakpoints
retain their selection after clicking, allowing them to be adjusted with the keyboard’s cursor keys, if
desired.

Envelope shapes can be copied and pasted from one oscillator to another in Operator using the
Envelope Display’s context menu.

As mentioned above, the filter and pitch envelopes also have adjustable slopes. Clicking on the
diamonds between the breakpoints allows you to adjust the slope of the envelope segments. Positive
slope values cause the envelope to move quickly at the beginning, then slower. Negative slope values
cause the envelope to remain flat for longer, then move faster at the end. A slope of zero is linear; the
envelope will move at the same rate throughout the segment.

With FM synthesis, it is possible to create spectacular, endless, permuting sounds; the key to doing this
is looping envelopes. Loop Mode can be activated in the lower left corner of the display. If an
envelope in Operator is in Loop Mode and reaches sustain level while the note is still being held, it
will be retriggered. The rate for this movement is defined by the Loop Time parameter. Note that
envelopes in Loop Mode can loop very quickly and can therefore be used to achieve effects that one
would not normally expect from an envelope generator.

While Loop Mode is good for textures and experimental sounds, Operator also includes Beat and
Sync Modes, which provide a simple way of creating rhythmical sounds. If set to Beat Mode, an
envelope will restart after the beat time selected from the Repeat chooser. In Beat Mode, the repeat
time is defined in fractions of song time, but notes are not quantized. If you play a note a bit out of
sync, it will repeat perfectly but stay out of sync. In Sync Mode however, the first repetition is
quantized to the nearest 16th note and, as a result, all following repetitions are synced to the song
tempo. Note that Sync Mode only works if the song is playing, and otherwise it will behave like Beat
Mode.

To avoid the audible clicks caused by restarting from its initial level, a looped envelope will restart
from its actual level and move with the set attack rate to peak level.

There is also a mode called Trigger that is ideal for working with percussive sounds. In this mode, Note
Off is ignored. This means that the length of time a key is held has no effect on the length of the sound.

The rates of all the envelopes in Operator can be scaled in unison by the Time control in the global
section of the shell. Note that beat-time values in Beat and Sync Modes are not influenced by the
global Time parameter. Envelope rates can be further modified by note pitch, as dictated by the Time
< Key parameter in the global section’s display. The rate of an individual envelope can also be
modified by velocity using the Time < Vel parameter. These modulations in conjunction with the loop
feature can be used to create very, very complex things…

The pitch envelope can be turned on or off for each individual oscillator and for the LFO using the
Destination A-D and LFO buttons in its display. The intensity of this envelope’s modulation of these
targets can be adjusted by the Dest. A slider and the envelope can be turned off altogether via the
switch in the pitch section of the shell.

Like the LFO, the pitch envelope can modulate an additional parameter as chosen by the Dest. B
chooser. The intensity of this modulation is determined by the Amt. B slider and the main Pitch Env
value.

The pitch and filter envelopes each have an additional parameter called End, which determines the
level the envelope will move to after the key is released. The rate of this envelope segment is
determined by the release time.

Tip: If the pitch envelope is only applied to the LFO and is looping, it can serve as another LFO,
modulating the rate of the first. And, since the envelope of the LFO itself can loop, it can serve as a
third LFO modulating the intensity of the first!

28.9.5 Filter Section

Operator’s Filter Display and Shell Parameters.

Operator’s filters can be very useful for modifying the sonically rich timbres created by the oscillators.
And, since the oscillators also provide you with the classic waveforms of analog synthesizers, you can
very easily build a subtractive synthesizer with them.

Operator offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a
special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 12 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection
of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware
filters found on some classic analog synthesizers.

The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ
Eight. This is available for all of the filter types.

The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping
diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all
filter types.

The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on
the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and
high-pass filters.

The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of
both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.

The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters
used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass
and high-pass filters.

The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance.
Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts
frequencies near that point.

When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is
an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the
filter.

The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-
pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.

You can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via
dedicated options in the context menu of the Morph slider.

The Envelope and Filter buttons in the filter section’s display area toggle between showing the filter
envelope and its frequency response. Filter cutoff frequency and resonance can be adjusted in the
shell or by dragging the filter response curve in the display area. Filter frequency can also be
modulated by the following:

•
•
•
•

Note velocity, via the Freq < Vel control in the filter’s display.
Note pitch, via the Freq < Key control in the filter’s display.
Filter envelope, via the Envelope control in the filter’s display.
LFO, done either by enabling the Dest. A “FIL“ switch in the LFO’s display, or by setting Dest. B
to Filter Freq.

The context menu for the Frequency knob contains an entry called “Play by Key.“ This automatically
configures the filter for optimal key tracking by setting Freq < Key to 100% and setting the cutoff to
466 Hz.

The filter’s signal can be routed through a waveshaper, whose curve type can be selected via the
Shaper chooser. The Shaper Drive (Shp. Drive) slider boosts or attenuates the signal level being sent
to the waveshaper, while the overall balance between the dry and processed signals can be adjusted
with the Dry/Wet control. With this set to 0%, the shaper and shaper drive parameters are bypassed.

28.9.6 Global Controls

Operator’s Global Display and Shell Parameters.

The global section contains parameters that affect Operator’s overall behavior. Additionally, the
global display area provides a comprehensive set of modulation routing controls.

The maximum number of Operator voices (notes) playing simultaneously can be adjusted with the
Voices parameter in the global display. Ideally, one would want to leave this setting high enough so

that no voices would be turned off while playing, however a setting between 6 and 12 is usually more
realistic when considering CPU power.

Tip: Some sounds should play monophonically by nature, which means that they should only use a
single voice. A flute is a good example. In these cases, you can set Voices to 1. If Voices is set to 1,
another effect occurs: Overlapping voices will be played legato, which means that the envelopes will
not be retriggered from voice to voice, and only pitch will change.

A global Volume control for the instrument can be found in the global section of the shell, and a Pan
control is located in the global section’s display. Pan can be modulated by note pitch or a random
factor, using the adjacent Pan < Key and Pan < Rnd controls, respectively.

The center of the global display allows for a wide variety of internal MIDI mappings. The MIDI
controllers Velocity, Key, Aftertouch, Pitch Bend and Mod Wheel can be mapped to two destinations
each, with independent modulation intensities set via the Amount sliders. Note that Time < Key and
pitch bend range have fixed assignments, although both modulation sources can still be routed to an
additional target. For more information about the available modulation options, see the complete
parameter list.

28.9.7 Glide and Spread

Operator’s Pitch Display and Shell Parameters.

Operator includes a polyphonic glide function. When this function is activated, new notes will start
with the pitch of the last note played and then slide gradually to their own played pitch. Glide can be
turned on or off and adjusted with the Glide Time control in the pitch display.

Operator also offers a special Spread parameter that creates a rich stereo chorus by using two voices
per note and panning one to the left and one to the right. The two voices are detuned, and the amount
of detuning can be adjusted with the Spread control in the pitch section of the shell.

Whether or not spread is applied to a particular note depends upon the setting of the Spread
parameter during the Note On event. To achieve special effects, you could, for instance, create a
sequence where Spread is 0 most of the time and turned on only for some notes. These notes will then
play in stereo, while the others will play mono. Note that Spread is a CPU-intensive parameter.

The pitch section also contains a global Transpose knob.

28.9.8 Strategies for Saving CPU Power

If you want to save CPU power, turn off features that you do not need or reduce the number of voices.
Specifically, turning off the filter or the LFO if they do not contribute to the sound will save CPU power.

For the sake of saving CPU resources, you will also usually want to reduce the number of voices to
something between 6 and 12, and carefully use the Spread feature. The Interpolation and Antialias
modes in the global display can also be turned off to conserve CPU resources.

Note that turning off the oscillators will not save CPU power.

28.9.9 Finally…

Operator is the result of an intense preoccupation with FM synthesis and a love and dedication to the
old hardware FM synthesizers, such as the Yamaha SY77, the Yamaha TX81Z and the NED Synclavier
II. FM synthesis was first explored musically by the composer and computer music pioneer John
Chowning in the mid-1960s. In 1973, he and Stanford University began a relationship with Yamaha
that lead to one of the most successful commercial musical instruments ever, the DX7.

John Chowning realized some very amazing and beautiful musical pieces based on a synthesis
concept that you can now explore yourself simply by playing with Operator in Live.

We wish you loads of fun with it!

28.9.10 The Complete Parameter List

The function of each Operator parameter is explained in the forthcoming sections. Remember that you
can also access explanations of controls in Live (including those belonging to Operator) directly from
the software by placing the mouse over the control and reading the text that appears in the Info View.
Parameters in this list are grouped into sections based on where they appear in Operator.

28.9.10.1 Global Shell and Display

Time — This is a global control for all envelope rates.

Tone — Operator is capable of producing timbres with very high frequencies, which can sometimes
lead to aliasing artifacts. The Tone setting controls the high frequency content of sounds. Higher
settings are typically brighter but also more likely to produce aliasing.

Volume — This sets the overall volume of the instrument.

Algorithm — An oscillator can modulate other oscillators, be modulated by other oscillators, or both.
The algorithm defines the connections between the oscillators and therefore has a significant impact
on the sound that is created.

Voices — This sets the maximum number of notes that can sound simultaneously. If more notes than
available voices are requested, the oldest notes will be cut off.

Retrigger (R) — When enabled, notes that are enabled will be retriggered, rather than generating an
additional voice.

Interpolation — This toggles the interpolation algorithm of the oscillators and the LFO. If turned off,
some timbres will sound more rough, especially the noise waveform. Turning this off will also save
some CPU power.

Antialias — This toggles Operator’s high-quality antialias mode, which helps to minimize high-
frequency distortion. Disabling this modes reduces the CPU load.

Time < Key — The rates of all envelopes can be controlled by note pitch. If the global Time < Key
parameter is set to higher values, the envelopes run faster when higher notes are played.

Pitch Bend Range (PB Range) — This defines the effect of MIDI pitch bend messages.

Pan — Use this to adjust the panorama of each note. This is especially useful when modulated with
clip envelopes.

Pan < Key (Key) — If Pan < Key is set to higher values, low notes will pan relatively more to the left
channel, and higher notes to the right. Typically this is used for piano-like sounds.

Pan < Random (Rnd) — This defines the extent to which notes are randomly distributed between the
left and right channels.

28.9.10.2 Modulation Targets

These modulation targets are available as MIDI routing destinations in the global display, and also as
modulation targets for the LFO and pitch envelope.

Off — Disabled this controller’s modulation routing.

OSC Volume A-D — Modulates the volume of the selected oscillator.

OSC Crossfade A/C — Crossfades the volumes of the A and C oscillators based on the value of the
modulation source.

OSC Crossfade B/D — Crossfades the volumes of the B and D oscillators based on the value of the
modulation source.

OSC Feedback — Modulates the amount of feedback for all oscillators. Note that feedback is only
applied to oscillators that are not modulated by other oscillators.

OSC Fixed Frequency — Modulates the pitch of all oscillators that are in Fixed Frequency mode.

FM Drive — Modulates the volume of all oscillators which are modulating other oscillators, thus
changing the timbre.

Filter Frequency — Modulates the cutoff frequency of the filter.

Filter Q (Legacy) — Modulates the resonance of the filter when using the legacy filter types.

Filter Res — Modulates the resonance of the filter when using the updated filter types.

Filter Morph — Modulates the position in the filter’s morph cycle (only has an effect for the Morph
filter type.)

Filter Drive — Modulates the amount of the Drive (not available when the Morph filter is selected.)

Filter Envelope Amount — Modulates the filter’s envelope intensity.

Shaper Drive — Modulates the amount of gain applied to the filter’s waveshaper.

LFO Rate — Modulates the rate of the LFO.

LFO Amount — Modulates the intensity of the LFO.

Pitch Envelope Amount — Modulates the intensity of the pitch envelope.

Volume — Modulates Operator’s global output volume.

Panorama — Modulates the position of Operator’s output in the stereo field.

Tone — Modulates the global Tone parameter.

Time — Modulates the global control for all envelope rates.

28.9.10.3 Pitch Shell and Display

Pitch Envelope On — This turns the pitch envelope on and off. Turning it off if it is unused saves some
CPU power.

Pitch Envelope Amount (Pitch Env) — This sets the overall intensity of the pitch envelope. A value of
100% means that the pitch change is exactly defined by the pitch envelope’s levels. A value of -100%
inverts the sign of the pitch envelope levels.

Spread — If Spread is turned up, the synthesizer uses two detuned voices per note, one each on the
left and right stereo channels, to create chorusing sounds. Spread is a very CPU-intensive effect.

Transpose — This is the global transposition setting for the instrument. Changing this parameter will
affect notes that are already playing.

Pitch Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — This parameter exists for filter, pitch, LFO and volume
envelopes. It is therefore listed in the section on envelopes.

Glide (G) — With Glide on, notes will slide from the pitch of the last played note to their played pitch.
Note that all envelopes are not retriggered in this case if notes are being played legato.

Glide Time (Time) — This is the time it takes for a note to slide from the pitch of the last played note to
its final pitch when Glide is activated. This setting has no effect if Glide is not activated.

Pitch Envelope to Osc (Destination A-D) — The pitch envelope affects the frequency of the respective
oscillator if this is turned on.

Pitch Envelope to LFO (Destination LFO) — The pitch envelope affects the frequency of the LFO if this is
turned on.

Pitch Envelope Amount A — This sets the intensity of the pitch envelope’s modulation of the oscillators
and LFO.

Pitch Envelope Destination B — This sets the second modulation destination for the pitch envelope.

Pitch Envelope Amount B — This sets the intensity of the pitch envelope’s modulation of the secondary
target.

28.9.10.4 Filter Shell and Display

Filter On — This turns the filter on and off. Turning it off when it is unused saves CPU power.

Filter Type — This chooser selects from low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and Morph filters.

Circuit Type — This chooser selects from a variety of circuit types that emulate the character of classic
analog synthesizers.

Filter Frequency (Freq) — This defines the center or cutoff frequency of the filter. Note that the resulting
frequency may also be modulated by note velocity and by the filter envelope.

Filter Resonance (Res) — This defines the resonance around the filter frequency of the low-pass and
high-pass filters, and the width of the band-pass and notch filters.

Envelope / Filter Switches — These switches toggle the display between the filter’s envelope and its
frequency response.

Filter Frequency < Velocity (Freq < Vel) — Filter frequency is modulated by note velocity according to
this setting.

Filter Frequency < Key (Freq < Key) — Filter frequency is modulated by note pitch according to this
setting. A value of 100% means that the frequency doubles per octave. The center point for this
function is C3.

Filter Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — This parameter exists for filter, pitch, LFO and volume
envelopes. It is therefore listed in the section on envelopes.

Filter Frequency < Envelope (Envelope) — Filter frequency is modulated by the filter envelope
according to this setting. A value of 100% means that the envelope can create a maximum frequency
shift of approximately 9 octaves.

Filter Drive (Flt. Drive) — Applies additional input gain to the signal before it enters the filter.

Morph — Controls the position of the Morph filter in its morph cycle.

Shaper — This chooser selects the curve for the filter’s waveshaper.

Shaper Drive (Shp. Drive) — This boosts or attenuates the signal level being sent to the waveshaper.

Dry/Wet — This adjusts the balance between the dry signal and the signal processed by the
waveshaper.

28.9.10.5 LFO Shell and Display

LFO On — This turns the LFO (low-frequency oscillator) on and off. Turning it off when it is unused
saves some CPU power.

LFO Waveform — Select from among several typical LFO waveforms. Sample and Hold (S&H)
creates random steps, and Noise supplies band-pass filtered noise. All waveforms are band-limited to
avoid unwanted clicks.

LFO Range — The LFO covers an extreme frequency range. Choose Low for a range from 50 seconds
to 30 Hz, or Hi for 8 Hz to 12 kHz. Sync causes the LFO’s rate to be synced to your Set’s tempo. Due
to the possible high frequencies, the LFO can also function as a fifth oscillator.

Retrigger (R) — When enabled, the LFO restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is
triggered. With R disabled, the LFO is free-running.

LFO Rate (Rate) — This sets the rate of the LFO. The actual frequency also depends on the setting of
the LFO Range and the LFO Rate < Key controls.

LFO Amount (Amount) — This sets the overall intensity of the LFO. Note that the actual effect also
depends on the LFO envelope.

LFO to Osc (Destination A-D) — The LFO modulates the frequency of the respective oscillator if this is
turned on.

LFO to Filter Cutoff Frequency (Destination FIL) — The LFO modulates the cutoff frequency of the filter if
this is turned on.

LFO Amount A — This sets the intensity of the LFO’s modulation of the oscillators and filter.

LFO Destination B — This sets the second modulation destination for the LFO.

LFO Amount B — This sets the intensity of the LFO’s modulation of the secondary target.

LFO Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — This parameter exists for filter, pitch, LFO and volume
envelopes. It is therefore listed in the section on envelopes.

LFO Rate < Key (Rate < Key) — The LFO’s frequency can be a function of note pitch. If this is set to
100%, the LFO will double its frequency per octave, functioning like a normal oscillator.

LFO Amount < Velocity (Amt < Vel) — This setting adjusts modulation of the LFO intensity by note
velocity.

28.9.10.6 Oscillators A-D Shell and Display

Osc On — This turns the oscillator on and off.

Osc Coarse Frequency (Coarse) — The relationship between oscillator frequency and note pitch is
defined by the Coarse and Fine parameters. Coarse sets the ratio in whole numbers, creating a
harmonic relationship.

Osc Fine Frequency (Fine) — The relationship between oscillator frequency and note pitch is defined
by the Coarse and Fine parameters. Fine sets the ratio in fractions of whole numbers, creating an
inharmonic relationship.

Osc Fixed Frequency On (Fixed) — In Fixed Mode, oscillators do not respond to note pitch but
instead play a fixed frequency.

Osc Fixed Frequency (Freq) — This is the frequency of the oscillator in Hertz. This frequency is
constant, regardless of note pitch.

Osc Fixed Multiplier (Multi) — This is used to adjust the range of the fixed frequency. Multiply this
value with the value of the oscillator’s Freq knob to get actual frequency in Hz.

Osc Output Level (Level) — This sets the output level of the oscillator. If this oscillator is modulating
another, its level has significant influence on the resulting timbre. Higher levels usually create bright
and/or noisy sounds.

Envelope / Oscillator Switches — These switches toggle the display between the oscillator’s envelope
and its harmonics editor.

16/32/64 — These switches set the number of partials that are available for user editing.

Osc Waveform (Wave) — Choose from a collection of carefully selected waveforms. You can then
edit them via the harmonics editor.

Osc Feedback (Feedback) — An oscillator can modulate itself if it is not modulated by another
oscillator. The modulation is dependent not only on the setting of the feedback control but also on the
oscillator level and the envelope. Higher feedback creates a more complex resulting waveform.

Osc Phase (Phase) — This sets the initial phase of the oscillator. The range represents one whole cycle.

Retrigger (R) — When enabled, the oscillator restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note
is triggered. With R disabled, the oscillator is free-running.

Repeat — Higher harmonics can be generated by repeating the drawn partials with a gradual
fadeout, based on the settings in the Repeat chooser. Low Repeat values result in a brighter sound,
while higher values result in more high-end roll-off and a more prominent fundamental. With Repeat
off, partials above the 16th, 32nd or 64th harmonic are truncated.

Osc Frequency < Velocity (Osc < Vel) — The frequency of an oscillator can be modulated by note
velocity. Positive values raise the oscillator’s pitch with greater velocities, and negative values lower it.

Osc Freq < Vel Quantized (Q) — This allows quantizing the effect of the Frequency < Velocity
parameter. If activated, the sonic result is the same as manually changing the Coarse parameter for
each note.

Volume Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — This parameter exists for filter, pitch, LFO and
volume envelopes. It is therefore listed in the section on envelopes.

Osc Output Level < Velocity (Vel) — This defines how much the oscillator’s level depends upon note
velocity. Applying this to modulating oscillators creates velocity-dependent timbres.

Osc Output Level < Key (Key) — This defines how much the oscillator’s level depends upon note pitch.
The center point for this function is C3.

28.9.10.7 Envelope Display

Envelope Attack Time (Attack) — This sets the time it takes for a note to reach the peak level, starting
from the initial level. For the oscillator envelopes, the shape of this segment of the envelope is linear.
For the filter and pitch envelopes, the shape of the segment can be adjusted.

Envelope Decay Time (Decay) — This sets the time it takes for a note to reach the sustain level from the
peak level. For the oscillator envelopes, the shape of this segment of the envelope is exponential. For
the filter and pitch envelopes, the shape of the segment can be adjusted.

Envelope Release Time (Release) — This is the time it takes for a note to reach the end level after a
Note Off message is received. For the oscillator envelopes, this level is always -inf dB and the shape
of the segment is exponential. For the filter and pitch envelopes, the end level is determined by the
End Level parameter and the shape of the segment can be adjusted. This envelope segment will begin
at the value of the envelope at the moment the Note Off message occurs, regardless of which
segment is currently active.

Envelope Initial Level (Initial) — This sets the initial value of the envelope.

Envelope Peak Level (Peak) — This is the peak level at the end of the note attack.

Envelope Sustain Level (Sustain) — This is the sustain level at the end of the note decay. The envelope
will stay at this level until note release unless it is in Loop, Sync or Beat Mode.

Envelope End Level (End) — (LFO, Filter and pitch envelopes only) This is the level reached at the end
of the Release stage.

Envelope Loop Mode (Loop) — If this is set to Loop, the envelope will start again after the end of the
decay segment. If set to Beat or Sync, it will start again after a given beat-time. In Sync Mode, this
behavior will be quantized to song time. In Trigger mode, the envelope ignores Note Off.

Envelope Beat/Sync Rate (Repeat) — The envelope will be retriggered after this amount of beat-time,
as long as it is still on. When retriggered, the envelope will move at the given attack rate from the
current level to the peak level.

Envelope Loop Time (Time) — If a note is still on after the end of the decay/sustain segment, the
envelope will start again from its initial value. The time it takes to move from the sustain level to the
initial value is defined by this parameter.

Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — Envelope segments will be modulated by note velocity as
defined by this setting. This is especially interesting if the envelopes are looping. Note that this
modulation does not influence the beat-time in Beat or Sync Modes, but the envelope segments
themselves.

The filter and pitch envelopes also provide parameters that adjust the slope of their envelope
segments. Positive slope values cause the envelope to move quickly at the beginning, then slower.
Negative slope values cause the envelope to remain flat for longer, then move faster at the end. A
slope of zero is linear; the envelope will move at the same rate throughout the segment.

Attack Slope (A.Slope) — Adjusts the shape of the Attack envelope segment.

Decay Slope (D.Slope) — Adjusts the shape of the Decay envelope segment.

Release Slope (R.Slope) — Adjusts the shape of the Release envelope segment.

28.9.10.8 Context Menu Options for Operator

Certain operations and parameters in Operator are only available via the context menu. These
include:

Copy commands for Oscillators — The context menu of the oscillator’s shell and envelope display
provide options for copying parameters between oscillators.

Envelope commands — The context menu for all envelope displays provide options to quickly set all
envelope levels to maximum, minimum, or middle values.

Harmonics editor commands — The context menu for the harmonics editor can restrict partial drawing
to even or odd harmonics and toggle normalization of an oscillator’s output level. There is also a
command to export the waveform as an .ams file.

Play By Key — This command, in the context menu for the filter’s Freq control, optimizes the filter for
key tracking by setting the cutoff to 466 Hz and setting the Freq < Key to 100%.

Enable Per-Note Pitch Bend — This option is enabled by default so that Operator responds to per-
note pitch bend changes. If needed, you can deactivate this behavior by deselecting the option in the
device title bar’s context menu.

28.10 Sampler

The Sampler Instrument.

Sampler is a sleek yet formidable multisampling instrument that takes full advantage of Live‘s agile
audio engine. It has been designed from the start to handle multi-gigabyte instrument libraries with
ease, and it imports most common library formats. But with Sampler, playback is only the beginning;
its extensive internal modulation system, which addresses nearly every aspect of its sound, makes it
the natural extension of Live‘s sound-shaping techniques.

28.10.1 Getting Started with Sampler

Getting started with Sampler is as easy as choosing a preset from the browser. Like all of Live‘s
devices, Sampler’s presets are located in folders listed beneath its name. Presets imported from third-
party sample libraries are listed here, too, in the Imports folder.

Once you have loaded a Sampler preset into a track, remember to arm the track for recording (which
also enables you to hear any MIDI notes you might want to play), and then start playing!

28.10.2 Multisampling

Before going on, let’s introduce the concept of multisampling. This technique is used to accurately
capture the complexity of instruments that produce dynamic timbral changes. Rather than rely on the
simple transposition of a single recorded sample, multisampling captures an instrument at multiple
points within its critical sonic range. This typically means capturing the instrument at different pitches as
well as different levels of emphasis (played softly, moderately, loudly, etc.). The resulting multisample
is a collection of all the individually recorded sample files.

The acoustic piano, for example, is a commonly multisampled instrument. Because the piano’s pitch
and dynamic ranges are very wide and timbrally complex, transposing one sample across many
octaves would not reproduce the nuances of the instrument. Since multisampling relies on different
sound sources, three or more samples per piano key could be made (soft, medium, loud, very loud,
and so on), maximizing the sampler’s expressive possibilities.

Sampler is designed to let you approach multisampling on whatever level you like: you can load and
play multisample presets, import multisamples from third-party vendors, or create your own

multisamples from scratch. Lastly, you do not have use multisamples at all — drop a single sample into
Sampler and take advantage of its internal modulation system however you like.

28.10.3 Title Bar Options

Sampler’s Title Bar Context Menu.

Before delving into Sampler’s deep modulation features, let’s look at Sampler’s title bar context menu
options.

Although Cut, Copy, Rename, Edit Info Text, and Delete should already be familiar, the other entries
deserve some explanation:

Group — Selecting this will load Sampler into a new Instrument Rack.

Fold — Folds Sampler so that only the device title bar is visible. Unfold quickly by double-clicking the
device title bar.

Show Preset Name — By default, Sampler takes the top-most sample in the sample layer list as its title.
Unchecking Show Preset Name will replace the current title with “Sampler.”

Lock to Control Surface — Locks Sampler to a natively supported control surface defined in the Link,
Tempo & MIDI Settings, guaranteeing hands-on access no matter where the current focus is in your
Live Set. By default, Sampler will automatically be locked to the control surface when the track is
armed for recording. A hand icon in the title bar of locked devices serves as a reminder of their
statuses.

Save as Default Preset — Saves the current state of Sampler as the default preset.

Use Constant Power Fade for Loops — By default, Sampler uses constant-power fades at loop
boundaries. Uncheck this to enable linear crossfades at looping points.

Sampler -> Simpler — Converts Sampler presets to Simpler presets. This lets you easily share Sets with
other musicians even if they don’t use a Live edition that includes Sampler.

28.10.4 Sampler’s Tabs

Sampler’s Tabs in the Title Bar.

Sampler’s features are organized categorically into tabs (Zone, Sample, Pitch/Osc, Filter/Global,
Modulation and MIDI), accessed from Sampler‘s title bar. Clicking a tab will, with the exception of the
Zone tab, reveal its properties below. In addition to serving as an organizational aid, each tab has
one or more LEDs that indicate if there is modulation information in the corresponding area. We will
get to know Sampler by examining each of these tabs.

28.10.5 The Zone Tab

The Zone Tab.

Clicking on the Zone tab toggles the display of Sampler‘s Zone Editor, which offers a hands-on
interface for mapping any number of samples across three types of ranges — the Key Zone, the
Velocity Zone and Sample Select Editors, respectively.

The Key Zone Editor.

The Zone Editor opens in its own dedicated view, directly above the Device View. When used in
conjunction with Sampler’s other tabs, this layout greatly accelerates the creation and editing of
multisamples.

On the left side of the Zone Editor is the sample layer list, where multisamples are organized. All of the
individual samples belonging to a multisample are shown in this list, where they are referred to as
layers. For complex multisamples, this list can be quite long.

Above the sample layer list are various buttons for configuring the sample layers and toggling the
different editors:

Auto Select (Auto) — As MIDI notes arrive at Sampler, they are filtered by each sample layer’s key,
velocity and sample select zones. With Auto Select enabled, all sample layers that are able to play
an incoming note will become selected in the sample layer list for the duration of that note.

Zone Fade Mode (Lin/Pow) — This button toggles the fade mode of all zones between linear and
constant-power (exponential) slopes.

Round Robin (RR) — This button toggles Round Robin sample playback on or off.

Zone Editor View (Key/Vel/Sel) — These buttons toggle the display of the Key Zone, Velocity Zone
and Sample Select Editors.

The rest of the view is occupied by one of three editors that correspond to the sample layers: the Key
Zone Editor, the Velocity Zone Editor and the Sample Select Editor. These editors can be horizontally
zoomed by right-clicking within them to bring up a context menu, and selecting Small, Medium or
Large.

28.10.5.1 Round Robin Sample Playback

Using Different Samples for Round Robin Playback.

Round Robin is a playback method that triggers a different sample each time a note is played. This lets
you cycle through a set of samples in a defined order over time.

You can, for example, use Round Robin to cycle through samples of the same sound or note with
different articulations to add subtle nuances to repetitive drum or note patterns. You can also use it
with radically different-sounding samples to create unexpected rhythmic or tonal changes throughout
a pattern.

To use Round Robin, enable the RR toggle in the Zone Editor.

Enable the RR Toggle to Activate Round Robin Playback.

Once enabled, any samples in the sample layer list that share the same key zone can be triggered
when a note within that range is played.

You can select an option in the Round Robin Mode chooser to determine how the samples are
triggered:

Forward — Cycles through samples in order starting from the top of the sample layer list to the bottom.
Once the last sample is played, the cycle begins again from the topmost sample.

Backward — Cycles through samples in order starting from the bottom of the sample layer list to the
top. The cycle is repeated once the topmost sample is played.

Other — Cycles through samples randomly; the same sample will never be triggered twice in a row.

Random — Cycles through samples randomly; multiple retriggers of the same sample are possible.

The Round Robin Mode Chooser.

You can set a specific interval at which the cycle restarts via the Reset Interval chooser. This is useful for
triggering samples predictably and consistently. For example, if the Round Robin Mode is set to
Forward with a reset interval of 1 bar, the topmost sample triggers on the first note of each bar. In
Backward mode, the cycle restarts from the bottommost sample. In Other or Random mode, the cycle
restarts from the sample that was first played.

The Reset Interval Chooser.

28.10.5.2 The Sample Layer List

The Sample Layer List.

All samples contained in the currently loaded multisample are listed here, with each sample given its
own layer. For very large multisamples, this list might be hundreds of layers long! Fortunately, layers
can be descriptively named (according to their root key, for example). Mousing over a layer in the list
or a zone in the zone editors will display relevant information about the corresponding sample in the
Status Bar (bottom of screen). Selecting any layer will load its sample into the Sample tab for
examination.

Right-clicking within the sample layer list opens a context menu that offers options for sorting and
displaying the layers, distributing them across the keyboard and various other sample management
and “housekeeping“ options.

Delete — Deletes the currently selected sample(s).

Duplicate — Duplicates the currently selected sample(s).

Rename — Renames the selected sample.

Distribute Ranges Equally — Distributes samples evenly across the editor’s full MIDI note range (C-2
to G8).

Distribute Ranges Around Root Key — For layers that have different root keys, this option will distribute
their ranges as evenly as possible around their root keys, but without overlapping. For layers that
share a root key, the ranges will be distributed evenly.

Small/Medium/Large — Adjusts the zoom level of the Zone Editor.

Show in Browser — Navigates to the selected sample in the browser and selects it.

Manage Sample — Opens the File Manager and selects the chosen sample.

Normalize Volume — Adjusts Sampler’s Volume control so that the highest peak of each selected
sample uses the maximum available headroom.

Normalize Pan — Adjusts Sampler’s Pan control so that each selected sample has equal volume
across the stereo spectrum. Note that this does not necessarily return panned stereo samples to the
center position; rather, Live intelligently calculates a pan position for an even stereo spread.

Select All With Same Range — Selects all layers whose zone range matches the currently selected
layer. The results will change depending on which Zone Editor (Key, Velocity or Sample Select) is
active.

Sort Alphabetically (Ascending and Descending) — Arranges samples alphabetically according to
their names.

Sort by Key (Ascending and Descending) — Sorts key zones in an ascending or descending pattern.

Sort by Velocity (Ascending and Descending) — Sorts velocity zones in an ascending or descending
pattern.

Sort by Selector (Ascending and Descending) — Sorts sample select zones in an ascending or
descending pattern.

28.10.5.3 Key Zones

The Key Zone Editor.

Key zones define the range of MIDI notes over which each sample will play. Samples are only
triggered when incoming MIDI notes lie within their key zone. Every sample has its own key zone,
which can span anywhere from a single key up to the full 127.

A typical multisampled instrument contains many individual samples, distributed into many key zones.
Samples are captured at a particular key of an instrument’s voice range (known as their root key), but
may continue to sound accurate when transposed a few semitones up or down. This range usually
corresponds to the sample’s key zone; ranges beyond this zone are represented by additional
samples, as needed.

By default, the key zones of newly imported samples cover the full MIDI note range. Zones can be
moved and resized like clips in the Arrangement View, by dragging their right or left edges to resize
them, then dragging them into position.

Zones can also be faded over a number of semitones at either end by dragging their top right or left
corners. This makes it easy to smoothly crossfade between adjacent samples as the length of the
keyboard is traversed. The Lin and Pow boxes above the sample layer list indicate whether the zones
will fade in a linear or exponential manner.

28.10.5.4 Velocity Zones

The Velocity Zone Editor.

Velocity zones determine the range of MIDI Note On velocities (1-127) that each sample will respond
to. The timbre of most musical instruments changes greatly with playing intensity. Therefore, the best
multisamples capture not only individual notes, but also each of those notes at different velocities.

The Velocity Zone Editor, when toggled, appears alongside the sample layer list. Velocity is measured
on a scale of 1-127, and this number range appears across the top of the editor. The functionality of
the Velocity Zone Editor is otherwise identical to that of the Key Zone Editor.

28.10.5.5 Sample Select Zones

The Sample Select Editor.

Each sample also has a Sample Select zone, which is a data filter that is not tied to any particular
kind of MIDI input. Sample Select zones are very similar to the Chain Select Zones found in Racks, in
that only samples with sample select values that overlap the current value of the sample selector will
be triggered.

The Sample Select Editor, when toggled, appears alongside the sample layer list. The editor has a
scale of 0-127, similar to the Velocity Zone Editor. Above the value scale is the draggable indicator
known as the sample selector.

The Sample Selector.

The position of the sample selector only determines which samples are available for triggering. Once
a sample has been triggered, changing the position of the sample selector will not switch to a different
sample during playback.

28.10.6 The Sample Tab

The Sample Tab.

The playback behavior of individual samples is set within the Sample tab. Most of this tab is dedicated
to displaying the waveform of the currently selected sample. Hovering your mouse over the waveform
will display relevant information about the sample in the Status Bar (bottom of screen). It is important
to keep in mind that most of the values in this tab reflect the state of the currently selected sample only.
The Sample chooser always displays the current sample layer’s name, and is another way to switch
between layers when editing.

To zoom in the current sample, scroll with the mousewheel or trackpad while holding the Ctrl
(Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier.

Reverse — This is a global, modulatable control that reverses playback of the entire multisample.
Unlike the Reverse function in the Clip View, a new sample file is not generated. Instead, sample
playback begins from the Sample End point, proceeds backwards through the Sustain Loop (if active),
and arrives at the Sample Start point.

Snap — Snaps all start and end points to the waveform zero-crossings (points where the amplitude is
zero) to avoid clicks. You can quickly see this by using Snap on square wave samples. As with
Simpler, this snap is based on the left channel of stereo samples, so a small Crossfade value may be
necessary in some cases to completely eliminate clicks. You can snap individual loop regions by right-
clicking on a loop brace and selecting “Snap Marker.”

Sample — Displays the name of the current sample layer, and can be used to quickly select different
layers of the loaded multisample.

Root Key (RootKey) — Defines the root key of the current sample.

Detune — Sample tuning can be adjusted here by +/- 50 cents.

Volume — A wide-range volume control, variable from full attenuation to a gain of +24 dB.

Pan — Samples can be individually panned anywhere in the stereo panorama.

28.10.6.1 Sample Playback

All of the following parameters work in conjunction with the global volume envelope (in the Filter/
Global tab) to create the basic voicing of Sampler. These envelopes use standard ADSR (Attack,
Decay, Sustain, Release) parameters, among others:

Envelope Attack Time (Attack) — This sets the time it takes for an envelope to reach the peak level,
starting from the initial level. The shape of the attack can be adjusted via the Attack Slope (A. Slope)
parameter.

Envelope Decay Time (Decay) — This sets the time it takes for an envelope to reach the sustain level
from the peak level. The shape of the decay can be adjusted via the Decay Slope (D. Slope)
parameter.

Envelope Sustain Level (Sustain) — This is the sustain level at the end of the envelope decay. The
envelope will stay at this level until note release unless it is in Loop, Sync or Beat Mode.

Envelope Release Time (Release) — This is the time it takes for an envelope to reach the end level after
a Note Off message is received. The shape of this stage of the envelope is determined by the Release
Slope (R. Slope) value.

Envelope Initial Level (Initial) — This sets the initial value of the envelope.

Envelope Peak Level (Peak) — This is the peak level at the end of the envelope attack, and the
beginning of the Decay stage.

Envelope End Level (End) — (LFO, Filter and pitch envelopes only) This is the level reached at the end
of the Release stage.

Envelope Rates < Velocity (Time < Vel) — Envelope segments will be modulated by note velocity as
defined by this setting. This is especially interesting if the envelopes are looping. Note that this
modulation does not influence the beat-time in Beat or Sync Modes, but the envelope segments
themselves.

Envelope Loop Mode (Loop) — If this is set to Loop, the envelope will start again after the end of the
decay segment. If set to Beat or Sync, it will start again after a given beat-time. In Sync Mode, this
behavior will be quantized to song time. In Trigger mode, the envelope ignores Note Off.

Envelope Beat/Sync Rate (Repeat) — The envelope will be retriggered after this amount of beat-time,
as long as it is still on. When retriggered, the envelope will move at the given attack rate from the
current level to the peak level.

Envelope Loop Time (Time) — If a note is still on after the end of the decay/sustain segment, the
envelope will start again from its initial value. The time it takes to move from the sustain level to the
initial value is defined by this parameter.

As mentioned above, Sampler’s envelopes also provide parameters that adjust the slope of their
envelope segments. Positive slope values cause the envelope to move quickly at the beginning, then
slower. Negative slope values cause the envelope to remain flat for longer, then move faster at the
end. A slope of zero is linear; the envelope will move at the same rate throughout the segment.

All time-based values in this tab are displayed in either samples or minutes:seconds:milliseconds,
which can be toggled using the context menu on any of their parameter boxes. Samples, in this
context, refer to the smallest measurable unit in digital audio, and not to the audio files themselves,
which we more commonly refer to as “samples.“

Sample Start — The time value where playback will begin. If the volume envelope’s Attack parameter
is set to a high value (slow attack), the audible result may begin some time later than the value shown
here.

Sample End — The time value where playback will end (unless a loop is enabled), even if the volume
envelope has not ended.

Sustain Mode — The optional Sustain Loop defines a region of the sample where playback will be
repeated while the note is in the sustain stage of its envelope. Activating the Sustain Loop also allows
the Release Loop to be enabled. This creates several playback options:

No Sustain Loop — Playback proceeds linearly until either the Sample End is reached or the

volume envelope completes its release stage.

Sustain Loop Enabled — Playback proceeds linearly until Loop End is reached, when it jumps
immediately to Loop Start and continues looping. If Release Mode is OFF, looping will continue inside
the Sustain Loop until the volume envelope has completed its release stage.

Back-and-Forth Sustain Loop Enabled — Playback proceeds to Loop End, then reverses until it

reaches Loop Start, then proceeds again towards Loop End. If Release Mode is OFF, this pattern
continues until the volume envelope has completed its release stage.

Link — Enabling the Link switch sets Sample Start equal to Loop Start. Note that the Sample Start
parameter box doesn’t lose its original value — it simply becomes disabled so that it can be recalled
with a single click.

Loop Start — The Sustain Loop’s start point, measured in samples.

Loop End — The Sustain Loop’s end point, measured in samples.

Release Mode — Whenever the Sustain Loop is active, Release Mode can also be enabled.

 — The volume envelope’s release stage is active, but will occur within the Sustain Loop, with

playback never proceeding beyond Loop End.

Release Enabled — When the volume envelope reaches its release stage, playback will proceed

linearly towards Sample End.

Release Loop Enabled — When the volume envelope reaches its release stage, playback will

proceed linearly until reaching Sample End, where it jumps immediately to Release Loop and
continues looping until the volume envelope has completed its release stage.

Back-and-Forth Release Loop Enabled — When the volume envelope reaches its release stage,
playback will proceed linearly until reaching Sample End, then reverses until it reaches Release Loop,
then proceeds again towards Sample End. This pattern continues until the volume envelope has
completed its release stage.

Release Loop — sets the start position of the Release Loop. The end of the Release Loop is the Sample
End.

Sustain- and Release-Loop Crossfade (Crossfade) — Loop crossfades help remove clicks from loop
transitions. By default, Sampler uses constant-power fades at loop boundaries. But by turning off “Use
Constant Power Fade for Loops“ in the context menu, you can enable linear crossfades.

Sustain- and Release-Loop Detune (Detune) — Since loops are nothing more than oscillations, the
pitch of samples may shift within a loop, relative to the loop’s duration. Tip: this is especially
noticeable with very short loops. With Detune, the pitch of these regions can be matched to the rest of
the sample.

Interpolation (Interpol) — This is a global setting that determines the accuracy of transposed samples.
Be aware that raising the quality level above “Normal“ to “Good” or “Best” will place significant
demands on your CPU.

RAM Mode (RAM) — This is also a global control that loads the entire multisample into RAM. This
mode can give better performance when modulating start and end points, but loading large
multisamples into RAM will quickly leave your computer short of RAM for other tasks. In any case, it is
always recommended to have as much RAM in your computer as possible, as this can provide
significant performance gains.

Hovering the mouse over the waveform and right-clicking to access the context menu provides a
number of editing and viewing options. As with the context menu in the Sample Layer List, Show in
Browser, Manage Samples, Normalize Volumes and Normalize Pan are available. Additionally, you
can zoom in or out of playing or looping regions, depending on which Sustain and Loop Modes are
selected.

Finally, a few options remain on the far-right side of the Sample tab:

Vertical Zoom (slider) — Magnifies the waveform height in the sample display. This is for visual clarity
only, and does not affect the audio in any way.

B, M, L and R Buttons — These buttons stand for Both, Mono, Left and Right, and allow you to choose
which channels of the sample should be displayed.

28.10.7 The Pitch/Osc Tab

The Pitch/Osc Tab.

28.10.7.1 The Modulation Oscillator (Osc)

Sampler features one dedicated modulation oscillator per voice, which can perform frequency or
amplitude modulation (FM or AM) on the multisample. The oscillator is fully featured, with 21
waveforms (available in the Type chooser), plus its own loopable amplitude envelope for dynamic
waveshaping. Note that this oscillator performs modulation only — its output is never heard directly.
What you hear is the effect of its output upon the multisample.

FM — In this mode, the modulation oscillator will modulate the frequency of samples, resulting in more
complex and different-sounding waveforms.

AM — In this mode, the modulation oscillator will modulate the amplitude of samples. Subsonic
modulator frequencies result in slow or rapid variation in the volume level; audible modulator
frequencies result in composite waveforms.

The modulation oscillator is controlled via Initial, Peak, Sustain, End, Loop, Attack and Time <
Velocities parameters. For detailed information on how these work, see the Sample Playback section.
Additionally, the right side of the modulation oscillator section features the following controls:

Type — Choose the modulation oscillator’s waveform here.

Volume — This determines the intensity of the modulation oscillator’s sample modulation.

Vol < Vel — The modulation oscillator’s Volume parameter can be modified by the velocity of
incoming MIDI notes. This determines the depth of the modulation.

Fixed — When enabled, the modulation oscillator’s frequency will remain fixed at the rate determined
by the Freq and Multi parameters, and will not change in response to incoming MIDI notes.

Freq — With Fixed set to On, this rate is multiplied by the Multi parameter to determine the modulation
oscillator’s fixed frequency.

Multi — With Fixed set to On, the Freq parameter is multiplied by this amount to determine the
modulation oscillator’s fixed frequency.

Coarse — Coarse tuning of the modulation oscillator’s frequency (0.125-48). This is only available
when Fixed is set to Off.

Fine — Fine tuning of the modulation oscillator’s frequency (0-1000). This is only available when
Fixed is set to Off.

28.10.7.2 The Pitch Envelope

The pitch envelope modulates the pitch of the sample over time, as well as of the Modulation
Oscillator, if it is enabled. This is a multi-stage envelope with ADSR, Initial, Peak, and End levels, as
described in the Sample Playback section. The values of the envelope parameters can be adjusted via
the sliders, or by dragging the breakpoints in the envelope’s display.

On the lower-left of the Pitch Envelope section is the Amount slider. This defines the limits of the pitch
envelope’s influence, in semitones. The actual range depends upon the dynamics of the envelope
itself.

The right-hand side of this section contains five sliders and one chooser that are unrelated to the Pitch
Envelope, but can globally effect Sampler’s output:

Spread — When Spread is used, two detuned voices are generated per note. This also doubles the
processing requirements.

Transpose (Transp) — Global transpose amount, indicated in semitones.

Detune — Global detune amount, indicated in cents.

Key Zone Shift (Zn Shft) — This transposes MIDI notes in the Key Zone Editor only, so that different
samples may be selected for playback, even though they will adhere to the played pitch. Good for
getting interesting artifacts from multisamples.

Glide — The global Glide mode, used in conjunction with the Time parameter to smoothly transition
between pitches. ’Glide’ is a standard monophonic glide, while ’Portamento’ works polyphonically.

Time — Enabling a Glide mode produces a smooth transition between the pitch of played notes. This
parameter determines the length of the transition.

The Filter/Global Tab.

28.10.8.1 The Filter

Sampler features a polyphonic filter with an optional integrated waveshaper. The filter section offers a
variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a special Morph filter.
Each filter can be switched between 12 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection of analog-modeled
circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware filters found on some
classic analog synthesizers.

The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ
Eight. This is available for all of the filter types.

The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping
diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all
filter types.

The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on
the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and
high-pass filters.

The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of
both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.

The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters
used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass
and high-pass filters.

The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance.
Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts
frequencies near that point.

When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is
an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the
filter.

The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-
pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.

You can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via
dedicated options in the context menu of the Morph slider.

To the right, the filter’s cutoff frequency can be modulated over time by a dedicated filter envelope.
This envelope works similarly to the envelopes in the Pitch/Osc tab, with Initial, Peak, Sustain and End
levels, ADSR, Loop mode and slope points. This area is toggled on/off with the F. Env button. The
Amount slider determines how much influence the filter envelope has on the filter’s cutoff frequency,
and needs to be set to a non-zero value for the envelope to have any effect.

Below the Filter is a waveshaper, which is toggled by clicking the Shaper button. Four different curves
can be chosen for the waveshaper in the Type selector: Soft, Hard, Sine and 4bit. Shaper’s overall
intensity can be controlled with the Amount slider. In addition, the signal flow direction can be
adjusted with the button above the waveshaper area: with the triangle pointing up, the signal passes
from the shaper to the filter; with the triangle pointing down, it passes from the filter to the shaper.

28.10.8.2 The Volume Envelope and Global Controls

The volume envelope is global, and defines the articulation of Sampler’s sounds with standard ADSR
(attack, decay, sustain, release) parameters. Please see the Sample Playback section for details on
these parameters.

This envelope can also be looped via the Loop chooser. When a Loop mode is selected, the Time/
Repeat slider becomes important. For Loop and Trigger modes, if a note is still held when the Decay
stage ends, the envelope will restart from its initial value. The time it takes to move from the Sustain
level to the initial value is defined by the Time parameter. For Beat and Sync modes, if a note is still
held after the amount set in the Repeat slider, the envelope will restart from its initial value.

The Pan slider is a global pan control (acting on all samples), while Pan < Rnd adds a degree of
randomness to the global pan position. Time (Global Time Envelope) will proportionally shrink or
expand the length of all envelopes in Sampler. Time < Key (Global Envelope Time < Key) will
proportionally shrink or expand the length of all envelopes in Sampler relative to the pitch of incoming
MIDI notes.

Finally, the Voices selector provides up to 32 simultaneous voices for each instance of Sampler. Voice
retriggering can optionally be enabled by activating the Retrigger button (R) to the right of the Voices
chooser. When activated, notes which are already playing will be retriggered, rather than generating
an additional voice. Turning Retrigger on can save CPU power, especially if a note with a long
release time is being triggered very often and very quickly.

28.10.9 The Modulation Tab

The Modulation Tab.

The Modulation tab offers an additional loopable envelope, plus three LFOs, all capable of
modulating multiple parameters, including themselves. Each LFO can be free running, or synced to the
Live Set’s tempo, and LFOs 2 and 3 can produce stereo modulation effects.

28.10.9.1 The Auxiliary Envelope

On the left, the Auxiliary (Aux) envelope functions much like the envelopes in the Pitch/Osc tab, with
Initial, Peak, Sustain and End levels, ADSR, Loop mode and slope points. This envelope can be routed
to 29 destinations in both the A and B choosers. How much the Auxiliary envelope will modulate
destinations A and B is set in the two sliders to the right.

28.10.9.2 LFOs 1, 2 and 3

The remaining space of the Modulation tab contains three Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs). As the
name implies, Sampler’s LFOs operate by applying a low-frequency (below 30 Hz) to a parameter in
order to modulate it. Engage any of these oscillators by clicking the LFO 1, LFO 2 or LFO 3 switches.

Type — Sampler’s LFOs have 6 different waveshapes available: Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth
Down, Sawtooth Up, and Sample and Hold.

Rate — With Hz selected, the speed of the LFO is determined by the Freq slider to the right. With the
note head selected, the LFO will be synced to beat-time, adjustable in the Beats slider to the right.

Freq — The LFO’s rate in Hertz (cycles per second), adjustable from 0.01 to 30 Hz.

Beats — This sets the LFO’s rate in beat-time (64th notes to 8 bars).

LFO Attack (Attack) — This is the time needed for the LFO to reach maximum intensity. Use this, for
example, to gradually introduce vibrato as a note is held.

LFO Retrigger (Retrig) — Enabling Retrigger for an LFO will cause it to reset to its starting point, or
initial phase, on each new MIDI note. This can create hybrid LFO shapes if the LFO is retriggered
before completing a cycle.

LFO Offset (Offset) — This changes the starting point, or initial phase of an LFO, so that it begins at a
different point in its cycle. This can create hybrid LFO shapes if the LFO is retriggered before
completing a cycle.

LFO Rate < Key (Key) — Also known as keyboard tracking, non-zero values cause an LFO’s rate to
increase relative to the pitch of incoming MIDI notes.

LFO 1 has four sliders for quickly modulating global parameters:

Volume (Vol) — LFO 1 can modulate the global volume level. This slider determines the depth of the
modulation on a 0-100 scale.

Pan (Pan) — LFO 1 can modulate the global pan position. This slider determines the depth of the
modulation on a 0-100 scale.

Filter — LFO 1 can modulate the filters cutoff frequency (Freq in the Filter/Global tab). This slider
determines the depth of the modulation on a 0-24 scale.

Pitch — LFO 1 can modulate the pitch of samples. This slider determines the depth of the modulation
on a 0-100 scale.

LFO Stereo Mode (Stereo) — LFOs 2 and 3 can produce two types of stereo modulation: Phase or
Spin. In phase mode, the right and left LFO channels run at equal speed, and the Phase parameter is
used to offset the right channel from the left. In spin mode, the Spin parameter can make the right LFO
channel run up to 50% faster than the left.

Like the Auxiliary envelope, LFOs 2 and 3 contain A and B choosers, where you can route LFOs to
many destinations.

28.10.10 The MIDI Tab

The MIDI Tab.

The MIDI tab’s parameters turn Sampler into a dynamic performance instrument. The MIDI controllers
Key, Velocity, Release Velocity, Aftertouch, Modulation Wheel, Foot Controller and Pitch Bend can be
mapped to two destinations each, with varying degrees of influence determined in the Amount A and
Amount B sliders.

For example, if we set Velocity’s Destination A to Loop Length, and its Amount A to 100, high
velocities will result in long loop lengths, while low velocities will create shorter ones.

At the bottom is a Pitch Bend Range slider (0 to 24 steps). The 14-bit range of pitch wheel values can
be scaled to produce up to 24 semitones of pitch bend in Sampler.

Finally, clicking in the Sampler image on the right will trigger a scrolling, movie-like credits for
Sampler. These are the people you can thank!

28.10.11 Importing Third-Party Multisamples

Sampler can use the following third-party sample formats:

•
•
•

REX files (supported in Live Standard and Suite only)
ACID Loops
Soundtrack Loops

Note that the tags in ACID Loops or Soundtrack Loops are not accessible in Live.

To import a third-party multisample, navigate to the file in Live‘s browser and drag it into a Live Set.
This will import it into your User Library.

Importing will create new Sampler presets, which you can find in the browser under User Library/
Sampler/Imports.

Note that some multisample files will be converted to Instrument Rack presets that contain several
Sampler instances used to emulate the original more accurately.
