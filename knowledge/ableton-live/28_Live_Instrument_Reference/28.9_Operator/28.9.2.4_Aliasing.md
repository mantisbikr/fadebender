# 28.9.2.4 Aliasing

Aliasing distortion is a common side effect of all digital synthesis and is the result of the finite sample
rate and precision of digital systems. It mostly occurs at high frequencies. FM synthesis is especially
likely to produce this kind of effect, since one can easily create sounds with lots of high harmonics. This
also means that more complex oscillator waveforms, such as “Saw 32,“ tend to be more sensitive to
aliasing than pure sine waves. Aliasing is a two-fold beast: A bit of it can be exactly what is needed
to create a cool sound, yet a bit too much can make the timbre unplayable, as the perception of pitch
is lost when high notes suddenly fold back into arbitrary pitches. Operator minimizes aliasing by
working in a high-quality Antialias mode. This is on by default for new patches, but can be turned off
in the global section. The Tone parameter in the global section also allows for controlling aliasing. Its
effect is sometimes similar to a low-pass filter, but this depends on the nature of the sound itself and
cannot generally be predicted. If you want to familiarize yourself with the sound of aliasing, turn Tone
up fully and play a few very high notes. You will most likely notice that some notes sound completely
different from other notes. Now, turn Tone down and the effect will be reduced, but the sound will be
less bright.
