# 28.9.2.1 Built-in Waveforms

The oscillators come with a built-in collection of basic waveform types — sine, sawtooth, square,
triangle and noise — which are selected from the Wave chooser in the individual oscillator displays.
The first of these waveforms is a pure, mathematical sine wave, which is usually the first choice for
many FM timbres. We also added “Sine 4 Bit“ and “Sine 8 Bit“ to provide the retro sound adored by
C64 fans, and “Saw D“ and “Square D“ digital waveforms, which are especially good for digital
bass sounds. The square, triangle and sawtooth waveforms are resynthesized approximations of the
ideal shape. The numbers included in the displayed name (e.g., “Square 6“) define how many
harmonics are used for the resynthesis. Lower numbers sound mellower and are less likely to create
aliasing when used on high pitches. There are also two built-in noise waveforms. The first, “Noise
Looped,“ is a looping sample of noise. For truly random noise, choose “Noise White.“
