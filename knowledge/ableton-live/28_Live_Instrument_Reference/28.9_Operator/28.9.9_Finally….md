# 28.9.9 Finally…

Operator is the result of an intense preoccupation with FM synthesis and a love and dedication to the
old hardware FM synthesizers, such as the Yamaha SY77, the Yamaha TX81Z and the NED Synclavier
II. FM synthesis was first explored musically by the composer and computer music pioneer John
Chowning in the mid-1960s. In 1973, he and Stanford University began a relationship with Yamaha
that lead to one of the most successful commercial musical instruments ever, the DX7.

John Chowning realized some very amazing and beautiful musical pieces based on a synthesis
concept that you can now explore yourself simply by playing with Operator in Live.

We wish you loads of fun with it!
