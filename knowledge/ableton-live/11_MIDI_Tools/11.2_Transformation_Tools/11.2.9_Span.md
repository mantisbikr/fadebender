# 11.2.9 Span

The Span MIDI Tool transforms the durations of selected notes using three articulation types: legato,
tenuto and staccato.

The Span Transformation.

It is also possible to introduce some variety to how notes are transformed with additional parameters:

•

•

Offset adjusts note end times up to a grid step. At positive values, note length is extended; at
negative values, note length is shortened.
Variation adds random variation to note lengths. At positive values, note length is shortened; at
negative values, note length is extended. If set to values other than 0%, new note length
variation will be produced whenever the Transformation is reapplied.

Legato extends the length of selected notes to the start time of the next note in the sequence. The last of
the selected notes will be extended to the end of the time selection or, if there is no time selection, to
the end of the loop.

Notes Before and After Applying Legato.

Tenuto preserves the original note length unless the Offset and Variation parameters are adjusted.

When using the Staccato articulation type, note length is determined by the distance between start
times of the selected notes. The smallest distance between start times is halved and this duration is
used as the new note length for the transformed notes. Note length can be further modified using the
Offset and Variation parameters.
