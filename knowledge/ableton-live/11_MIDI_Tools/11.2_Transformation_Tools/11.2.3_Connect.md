# 11.2.3 Connect

The Connect Transformation generates new notes that fill the gaps between existing notes. The
placement of the interpolated notes is randomized, but some particulars of the pattern can be
determined using Connect’s parameters.

The Connect MIDI Tool.

The Spread control sets the maximum random pitch shift of the connecting notes based on the original
note pitches, in scale degrees or semitones.

Density allows you to specify the percentage of the time interval between original notes to be filled
with interpolated notes. At 100%, all the gaps between existing notes will be filled.

Use the Rate control to set the length of the interpolated notes and the Tie control to determine the
probability that the length of a generated note will be extended to the next original note.

Notes Before and After Applying the Connect Transformation.
