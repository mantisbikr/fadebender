# 11.2.1 Arpeggiate

The Arpeggiate Transformation splits up the note selection into arpeggiated notes based on the
chosen pattern settings. It uses the core functionalities found in the Arpeggiator MIDI effect.

The Arpeggiate MIDI Tool.

The Style drop-down menu allows you to select an arpeggiated sequence which will be applied to
the selected notes. The Arpeggiate Transformation offers the same 18 style patterns known from
Arpeggiator.

The Distance control determines the transposition of steps in the pattern using scale degrees or
semitones, depending on whether a scale is set for the clip.

The Steps slider allows you to select the number of transposed steps in the pattern.

The Rate and Gate controls determine how notes are distributed on a timeline: the former sets the rate
of the pattern (which also affects note length), while the latter affects note duration. When Gate is set
to values below 100%, notes will be shortened, whereas at values above 100% notes will be
lengthened.
