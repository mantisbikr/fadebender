# 11.2.12 Velocity Shaper

Velocity Shaper is a Max for Live Transformation.

The Velocity Shaper MIDI Tool.

Velocity Shaper allows you to shape the velocities of selected notes using an adjustable envelope.

The envelope shape in the display will influence how the velocities of the selected notes are
transformed. Click in the display to add more breakpoints to the envelope and drag them to adjust the
envelope shape.

You can use the Minimum and Maximum Velocity parameters on the right of the display to define the
velocity range for the transformed notes.

The Loop parameter below the display sets the number of times the envelope shape will be applied to
the note selection.

The Rotate control determines the number of steps the envelope shape is offset, relative to the start of
the note selection. The size of the step is determined by the Division parameter. For example, if Rotate
is set to 1 and Division is set to “Grid”, the envelope shape will be shifted to the right by one grid step.
