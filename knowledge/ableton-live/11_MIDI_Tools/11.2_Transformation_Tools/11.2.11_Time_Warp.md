# 11.2.11 Time Warp

Time Warp is a time-stretching MIDI Tool that transforms selected notes according to a speed curve.
This allows creating tempo variations such as accelerando or ritardando.

The Time Warp Transformation.

You can create the speed curve in the Breakpoints display. The time range of the curve is mapped to
the time selection. It is possible to enable between one and three breakpoints in the speed curve using
their respective toggles. You can either drag a breakpoint in the display or select it and use the
Breakpoint Time and Breakpoint Speed sliders to set the breakpoint’s timeline position and speed,
respectively. The sliders’ values always reflect the values of the currently selected breakpoint.

The toggles below the Breakpoints display allow you to make further adjustments to the time-warping
applied. When Quantize is on, the warped notes will be quantized according to the grid settings.
When the Preserve Time Range switch is enabled, the results of the Transformation will fit within the
same range as the original note selection. When the Include Note End switch is toggled on, the end
positions of the original notes are taken into account when applying the speed curve, which will have
an effect on the duration of the original notes.
