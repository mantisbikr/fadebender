# 11.2.7 Quantize

The Quantize MIDI Tool adjusts the timing of selected notes by moving or stretching them according to
the specified quantization settings. Note that an equivalent Quantize tool exists for audio clips.

The Quantize Transformation.

You can transform notes according to the current grid size or set a specific meter value for
quantization (including triplets). It’s possible to quantize note start or end time, or both note start and
end time simultaneously. Quantizing the note end will stretch the note so that it ends at the chosen
meter subdivision. You can also quantize notes without giving them that “quantized” sound using the
Amount control, which will move notes only by a percentage of the set quantization value.

Notes Before and After Applying Quantization.

Aside from navigating to the Transformation using Clip View’s tabs/panels, you can also open the
Quantize MIDI Tool to change its parameters by using the Quantize Settings… command in the Edit
menu, or use the Ctrl
to the selected notes without opening the Transform tab/panel.
