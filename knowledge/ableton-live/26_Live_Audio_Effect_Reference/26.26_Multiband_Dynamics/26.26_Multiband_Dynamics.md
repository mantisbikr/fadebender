# 26.26 Multiband Dynamics

The Multiband Dynamics Effect.

The Multiband Dynamics device is a flexible tool for modifying the dynamic range of audio material.
Designed primarily as a mastering processor, Multiband Dynamics allows for upward and downward
compression and expansion of up to three independent frequency bands, with adjustable crossover
points and envelope controls for each band. Each frequency range has both an upper and lower
threshold, allowing for two types of dynamics processing to be used simultaneously per band.

26.26.1 Dynamics Processing Theory

To understand how to use the Multiband Dynamics device, it helps to understand the four different
methods of manipulating dynamics.

When we use the term “compression,” we’re typically talking about lowering the level of signals that
exceed a threshold. This is how Live’s Compressor works, and is more accurately called downward
compression because it pushes loud signals down, thus reducing the dynamic range. But it is also
possible to reduce a signal’s dynamic range by raising the levels of signals that are below a threshold.
This much-less-common form of compression is called upward compression. As you can see from this
diagram, employing either type of compression results in a signal with a smaller dynamic range than
the original.

Downward and Upward Compression.

The opposite of compression is expansion. A typical expander lowers the levels of signals that are
below a threshold. This is how Live’s Gate works, and is more accurately called downward expansion
because it pushes quiet signals down, thus increasing the dynamic range. It is also possible to increase
a signal’s dynamic range by raising the levels of signals that are above a threshold. Like upward
compression, this technique is known as upward expansion and is much less common. This diagram
shows that either type of expansion results in a signal with a larger dynamic range.

Downward and Upward Expansion.

To summarize:

•
•
•
•

Downward compression (common): make loud signals quieter
Upward compression (uncommon): make quiet signals louder
Downward expansion (common): make quiet signals quieter
Upward expansion (uncommon): make loud signals louder

The Multiband Dynamics device allows for all of these types of processing. In fact, because the device
allows for incoming audio to be divided into three frequency bands, and each band has both an

upper and lower threshold, a single instance of Multiband Dynamics can provide six types of
dynamics processing simultaneously.

26.26.2 Interface and Controls

The High and Low buttons toggle the high and low bands on or off. With both bands off, the device
functions as a single-band effect. In this case, only the Mid controls affect the incoming signal. The
frequency sliders below the High and Low buttons adjust the crossovers that define the frequency
ranges for each band. If the low frequency is set to 500 Hz and the high frequency is set to 2000 Hz,
then the low band goes from 0 Hz to 500 Hz, the mid band from 500 Hz to 2000 Hz and the high
band from 2000 Hz up to whatever your soundcard or sample rate supports.

Each band has activator and solo buttons. With the activator button disabled for a given band, its
compression/expansion and gain controls are bypassed. Soloing a band mutes the others. The Input
knobs boost or attenuate the level of each band before it undergoes dynamics processing, while the
Output knobs to the right of the display adjust the levels of the bands after processing.

The display area provides a way of both visualizing your dynamics processing and adjusting the
relevant compression and expansion behavior. For each band, the output level is represented by large
bars, while the input level before processing is represented by small bars. With no processing applied,
the input meters will be aligned with the top of the output meters. The scaling along the bottom of the
display shows dB. As you adjust the gain or dynamics processing for a band, you can see how its
output changes in comparison to its input.

As you move your mouse over the display, the cursor will change to a bracket as it passes over the
edges of the blocks on the left or right side. These blocks represent the signal levels under the Below
and over the Above thresholds, respectively. Dragging left or right on the edges of these blocks
adjusts the threshold level. Holding down Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) while dragging a threshold
will adjust the same threshold for all bands. Hold down Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) to
simultaneously adjust the Above and Below thresholds for a single band. Holding down Shift
while dragging left or right allows you to adjust the threshold of a single band at a finer resolution.

As you mouse over the middle of the block, the cursor will change to an up-down arrow. Click and
drag up or down to make the signal within the selected volume range louder or quieter. Holding
down Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) while dragging up or down will adjust the volume of the same
block for all bands. Hold down Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) to simultaneously adjust the Above
and Below volumes for a single band. Holding down Shift while dragging up or down allows you
to adjust the volume of a single band at a finer resolution. Double-clicking within the region resets the
volume to its default.

In technical terms, lowering the volume in the block above the Above threshold applies downward
compression, while raising it applies upward expansion. Likewise, lowering the volume in the block
below the Below threshold applies downward expansion, while raising it applies upward
compression. In all cases, you are adjusting the ratio of the compressor or expander.

The thresholds and ratios of all bands can also be adjusted via the column to the right of the display.
The ”T,” ”B” and ”A” buttons at the bottom right of the display area toggle between displaying the

Time (attack and release), Below (threshold and ratio) and Above (threshold and ratio) for each
band.

For the Above thresholds, Attack defines how long it takes to reach maximum compression or
expansion once a signal exceeds the threshold, while Release sets how long it takes for the device to
return to normal operation after the signal falls below the threshold.

For the Below thresholds, Attack defines how long it takes to reach maximum compression or
expansion once a signal drops below the threshold, while Release sets how long it takes for the
device to return to normal operation after the signal goes above the threshold.

With Soft Knee enabled, compression or expansion begins gradually as the threshold is approached.

The RMS/Peak switch also affects how quickly Multiband Dynamics responds to level changes. With
Peak selected, the device reacts to short peaks within a signal. RMS mode causes it to be less sensitive
to very short peaks and to begin processing only when the incoming level has crossed the threshold
for a slightly longer time.

The global Output knob adjusts the overall output gain of the device.

The Time control scales the durations of all of the Attack and Release controls. This allows you to
maintain the same relative envelope times, but make them all faster or slower by the same amount.

The Amount knob adjusts the intensity of the compression or expansion applied to all bands. At 0%,
each compressor/expander has an effective ratio of 1, meaning that it has no effect on the signal.

26.26.3 Sidechain Parameters

The Multiband Dynamics Device With Sidechain Section.

Normally, the signal being processed and the input source that triggers the device are the same
signal. But by using sidechaining, it is possible to apply dynamics processing to a signal based on the
level of another signal or a specific frequency component. To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold
the Multiband Dynamics window by toggling the

 button in its title bar.

Enabling the Sidechain button allows you to select any of Live’s internal routing points from the
choosers below. This causes the selected source to act as the device’s trigger, instead of the signal that
is actually being processed.

The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you
to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the trigger. With Dry/Wet at 100%, the
device is triggered entirely by the sidechain source. At 0%, the sidechain is effectively bypassed. Note
that increasing the gain does not increase the volume of the source signal in the mix. The sidechain
audio is only a trigger for the device and is never actually heard.

The headphones button allows you to listen to only the sidechain input, bypassing the device’s output.
Since the sidechain audio isn’t fed to the output, and is only a trigger for the device, this temporary
listening option can make it much easier to set sidechain parameters and hear what’s actually making
the device work.

26.26.4 Multiband Dynamics Tips

Multiband Dynamics is a feature-rich and powerful device, capable of up to six independent types of
simultaneous processing. Because of this, getting started can be a bit intimidating. Here are some
real-world applications to give you some ideas.

26.26.4.1 Basic Multiband Compression

By using only the upper thresholds, Multiband Dynamics can be used as a traditional ”downward”
compressor. Adjust the crossover points to suit your audio material, then apply downward
compression (by dragging down in the upper blocks in the display or by setting the numerical ratios to
values greater than 1.)

26.26.4.2 De-essing

To remove ”harshness” caused by overly loud high frequency content, try enabling only the upper
band and setting its crossover frequency to around 5 kHz. Then gradually adjust the threshold and
ratio to apply subtle downward compression. It may help to solo the band to more easily hear the
results of your adjustments. Generally, de-essing works best with fairly fast attack and release times.

26.26.4.3 Uncompression

Mastering engineers are often asked to perform miracles, like adding punch and energy to a mix that
has already been heavily compressed, and thus has almost no remaining transients. Most of the time,
these mixes have also been heavily maximized, meaning that they also have no remaining headroom.
Luckily, upward expansion can sometimes help add life back to such overly squashed material. To do
this:

1.
2.
3.

Turn down the Input knob to provide some additional headroom.
Adjust the Above thresholds for the bands so that they’re below the highest peaks.
Add a small amount of upward expansion to each band. Be careful — excessive upward
expansion can make transients very loud.

4.

Carefully adjust the attack and release times for each band. Note that, unlike in typical
downward compression, very fast attack times will increase the impact of transients, while
slower times result in a more muffled sound.

Note: Adding a maximizer or limiter to boost gain after you’ve returned some peaks to your material
may simply destroy them again.
