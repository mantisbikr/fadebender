# 26.26.4.3 Uncompression

Mastering engineers are often asked to perform miracles, like adding punch and energy to a mix that
has already been heavily compressed, and thus has almost no remaining transients. Most of the time,
these mixes have also been heavily maximized, meaning that they also have no remaining headroom.
Luckily, upward expansion can sometimes help add life back to such overly squashed material. To do
this:

1.
2.
3.

Turn down the Input knob to provide some additional headroom.
Adjust the Above thresholds for the bands so that they’re below the highest peaks.
Add a small amount of upward expansion to each band. Be careful — excessive upward
expansion can make transients very loud.

4.

Carefully adjust the attack and release times for each band. Note that, unlike in typical
downward compression, very fast attack times will increase the impact of transients, while
slower times result in a more muffled sound.

Note: Adding a maximizer or limiter to boost gain after you’ve returned some peaks to your material
may simply destroy them again.
