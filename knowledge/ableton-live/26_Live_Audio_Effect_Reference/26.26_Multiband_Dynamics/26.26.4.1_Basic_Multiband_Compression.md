# 26.26.4.1 Basic Multiband Compression

By using only the upper thresholds, Multiband Dynamics can be used as a traditional ”downward”
compressor. Adjust the crossover points to suit your audio material, then apply downward
compression (by dragging down in the upper blocks in the display or by setting the numerical ratios to
values greater than 1.)
