# 26.26.4.2 De-essing

To remove ”harshness” caused by overly loud high frequency content, try enabling only the upper
band and setting its crossover frequency to around 5 kHz. Then gradually adjust the threshold and
ratio to apply subtle downward compression. It may help to solo the band to more easily hear the
results of your adjustments. Generally, de-essing works best with fairly fast attack and release times.
