# 26.22 Grain Delay

The Grain Delay Effect.

The Grain Delay effect slices the input signal into tiny particles (called ”grains”) that are then
individually delayed and can also have different pitches compared to the original signal source.
Randomizing pitch and delay time can create complex masses of sound and rhythm that seem to bear

little relationship to the source. This can be very useful in creating new sounds and textures, as well as
getting rid of unwelcome house guests, or terrifying small pets (just kidding!).

You can route each parameter to the X-Y controller’s horizontal or vertical axis. To assign a parameter
to the X-axis, choose it from the parameter row below the controller. To assign a parameter to the Y-
axis, use the parameter row on the left side.

To refer delay time to the song tempo, activate the Sync switch, which allows using the Delay Time
beat division chooser. The numbered switches represent time delay in 16th notes. For example,
selecting ”4” delays the signal by four 16th notes, which equals one beat (a quarter note) of delay.
With Sync Mode active, changing the Delay Time field percentage value shortens and extends delay
times by fractional amounts, thus producing the ”swing” type of timing effect found in drum machines.

If the Sync switch is off, the delay time reverts to milliseconds. In this case, to edit the delay time, click
and drag up or down in the Delay Time field, or click in the field and type in a value.

The Delay Time can also be routed to the horizontal axis of the X-Y controller.

The Spray control adds random delay time changes. Low values smear the signal across time, which
adds ”noisiness” to the sound. High Spray values completely break down the structure of the source
signal, introducing varying degrees of rhythmic chaos. This is the recommended setting for anarchists.

The size and duration of each grain is a function of the Frequency parameter. The sound of Pitch and
Spray depends very much on this parameter.

You can transpose the grain pitch with the Pitch parameter, which acts much like a crude pitch shifter.

The Random Pitch control adds random variations to each grain’s pitch. Low values create a sort of
mutant chorusing effect, while high values can make the original source pitch completely
unintelligible. This parameter can interact with the main Pitch control, thus allowing degrees of stability
and instability in a sound’s pitch structure.

The Feedback parameter sets how much of the output signal returns to the delay line input. Very high
values can lead to runaway feedback and produce a loud oscillation — watch your ears and
speakers if you decide to check out extreme feedback settings!

Grain Delay also has a dry/wet control, which can be routed to the vertical axis of the X-Y controller.

26.23 Hybrid Reverb

The Hybrid Reverb Effect.

Hybrid Reverb combines two different approaches to reverberation in one device, blending
convolution reverb with a number of digital reverb algorithms. Using multiple routing options and
parameters, you can create unique reverb sounds, or use Hybrid Reverb to generate drone-like
soundscapes or completely transform any source material.

In addition to providing a selection of impulse responses, Hybrid Reverb allows you to import any
audio file to use as an impulse response (also known as an IR), greatly increasing your sound design
opportunities. Dedicated controls can be employed to shape any chosen impulse response.

The algorithmic engine contains several reverb modes, each providing a different set of parameters
and sonic properties, ranging from clean and creamy to metallic and gong-like.

The convolution and algorithmic engines can be used independently, or combined together in series
or parallel, with their volume relationship being continuously adjustable. An EQ section further shapes
the reverb’s sound and can be selectively applied to the two reverb engines. An additional control
introduces degradation of the signal, emulating the behavior of older digital reverb units.

26.23.1 Signal Flow

You can imagine signals being processed by Hybrid Reverb as flowing from the left side of the device
towards the right side, passing first through the input section, then into the reverb engines. The
relationship between the two reverb engines is affected by the routing section, after which the signal
passes through the EQ section, and then finally to the output.

The convolution reverb engine’s controls are yellow in color, while the algorithmic engine’s controls
are displayed in blue.

26.23.2 Input Section

Using the Send knob, you can choose the amount of gain applied to the signal that feeds the reverb.
Note that the dry signal is not affected and will still pass through the device.

Predelay controls the delay time before the onset of the first early reflection. This delays the
reverberation relative to the input signal. One’s impression of the size of a real room depends partly
on this delay; typical values for “natural” sounds range from 1ms to 25ms. You can choose either a
time-based or beat-synced predelay time using the Predelay Sync buttons.

Feedback sets the amount of the predelay’s output that is fed back to its input. Note that both time-
based and beat-based predelay times have independent feedback settings.

The main window of Hybrid Reverb has two tabs: Reverb and EQ. The Reverb tab contains all controls
related to both the convolution and algorithmic reverb engines. Starting with the Routing chooser in
the center, you’ll find four options:

•

•

•
•

Serial routes the output of the convolution engine into the algorithmic engine. While the
convolution reverb is always active in this mode, Blend controls the amount of convolution
reverb fed into the algorithmic reverb. A setting of 100/0 produces pure convolution reverb,
while 0/100 generates pure algorithmic reverb which has been fed by the convolution reverb’s
output.
Parallel uses both convolution and algorithmic reverb engines, but separates them from each
other. The Blend knob adjusts the level balance between the two different reverb engines, with
a setting of 100/0 generating pure convolution reverb and 0/100 producing pure algorithmic
reverb.
Algorithm uses only the algorithmic reverb engine.
Convolution uses only the convolution reverb engine.

Hybrid Reverb’s user interface changes dynamically, so that when a reverb engine is not in use, its
controls will appear grayed out.

The Blend knob blends between the output of the convolution and algorithm sections when Routing is
set to Serial or Parallel. Note that when either Algorithm or Convolution is selected in the Routing
chooser, the Blend knob will not have an effect.

26.23.3 Convolution Reverb Engine

Hybrid Reverb’s Convolution Reverb Section.

A convolution reverb uses recordings of actual spaces (called impulse responses) to create its effect.
This allows you to place your sounds in practically any space for which you have a recording. For a
more typical reverb sound, this can include some of the most famous halls and studios throughout the

world. With a more creative approach, you can use recordings of anything, from snare drums to
garbage cans, or even instrumental and vocal recordings!

Impulse responses can be chosen in the Convolution IR menu. The upper drop-down menu chooses
the category of impulse response, while the lower drop-down menu chooses a specific impulse
response from within that category. Backward and forward arrow buttons are provided for easy
browsing through impulse responses. These arrow buttons will automatically switch to the next
category when you reach the end of the current one, so you can continuously move through the
impulse responses using the arrows alone. The chosen impulse response’s waveform is then shown in
the main display, which changes based on the Attack, Decay, and Size settings (described below).

The various impulse response categories are: Early Reflections, Real Places, Chambers and Large
Rooms, Made for Drums, Halls, Plates, Springs, Bigger Spaces, Textures, and User.

To add your own impulse responses to the User category, drag and drop the IR audio file into Hybrid
Reverb’s convolution waveform display. If you add a file from a folder that contains other audio files,
all files will be added as impulse responses. Note: if you remove Hybrid Reverb from a track and add
it again, the previously added User samples will no longer be available in the User category.
However, you can drag and drop the samples into the waveform display again to repopulate the list.

The Attack, Decay, and Size parameters control the impulse response’s amplitude envelope. The
Attack parameter controls the attack time of the envelope, while the Decay parameter controls the
decay time of the envelope. The Size parameter adjusts the relative size of the impulse response.

26.23.4 Algorithmic Reverb Engine

Hybrid Reverb’s Algorithmic Reverb Section.

In comparison to the convolution engine, the algorithmic engine is based purely on digital delay lines,
and no samples are used.

To the right of the Blend knob you will find the controls for the algorithmic reverb engine. Different
parameters will be displayed depending on what you choose in the Algorithm chooser.

Five different algorithms are available: Dark Hall, Quartz, Shimmer, Tides and Prism. For all
algorithms, the Decay, Size, Delay and Freeze parameters are available.

Decay adjusts the approximate time required for the algorithm’s reverb tail to drop to 1/1000th (-60
dB) of its initial amplitude. Size controls the size of the virtual room. Delay sets an additional predelay
time in milliseconds for the algorithm section.

The Freeze controls consist of two buttons, Freeze and Freeze In. Freeze disables any input to the
reverb engine and sets the algorithm’s decay time to infinite, so that reverb output will sustain
endlessly. When enabled, Freeze In adds the input signal to the frozen reverberation, leading to a
build-up of reverberated sound.

Each algorithm and their unique parameters are described in further detail below.

26.23.4.1 Dark Hall

The Dark Hall algorithm is a smooth and classic sounding algorithm suitable for most medium to long
sounding halls.

In addition to the shared parameters listed above, Dark Hall also provides the following:

•

•

•

•

•

Damping controls the amount of high-frequency filtering within the reverb algorithms. Higher
values result in darker reverberation sounds.
Mod controls the amount of movement within the algorithm’s reverb tail. Less modulation
produces less movement, and more modulation creates more movement with a chorusing effect,
while diminishing the effect of resonances.
Shape transforms the artificial space’s sonic characteristics from small and resonant to large
and diffused.
Bass X controls the crossover frequency of the low-end part of the reverb tail, which is scaled
using the Bass Mult control.
Bass Mult scales the decay time of the low-end of the reverb tail.

In Dark Hall mode, long decay times combined with extremely small Size values create metallic
gong-like resonances.

26.23.4.2 Quartz

The Quartz algorithm is a hall-like reverb with some audible echoes in the reverb’s tail. This reverb has
a very clear replication of the input in the early reflections and is well suited for voices, drums and
signals with clear transients, as well as making echoes.

In addition to the shared parameters listed above, Quartz also provides the following:

•

•

•

Damping controls the amount of high-frequency filtering within the reverb algorithms. Higher
values result in darker reverberation sounds.
Lo Damp controls the amount of low frequency filtering within the reverb algorithms. Higher
values result in brighter reverberation sounds.
Mod controls the amount of movement within the algorithm’s reverb tail. Less modulation
produces less movement, and more modulation creates more movement with a chorusing effect,
while diminishing the effect of resonances.

•

•

Diffusion controls the density of the algorithm’s reverb tail. Low values produce sparser tails,
while higher values produce denser tails.
Distance controls the virtual distance of reflections. Lower values put them closer to the listener
and increase their density while higher values place them farther away and increase the time
between echoes.

26.23.4.3 Shimmer

The Shimmer reverb algorithm is made from densely stacked diffuse delays with a pitch shifter in the
feedback. Low diffusion values result in a pure delay, while high diffusion values result in a dense and
lush artificial reverb. The Shimmer effect crossfades the pitch-shifted signal into the feedback, resulting
in tails that climb or descend in frequency.

In addition to the shared parameters listed above, Shimmer also provides the following:

•

•

•
•

•

Damping controls the amount of high-frequency filtering within the reverb algorithms. Higher
values result in darker reverberation sounds.
Mod controls the amount of movement within the algorithm’s reverb tail. Less modulation
produces less movement, and more modulation creates more movement with a chorusing effect,
while diminishing the effect of resonances.
Pitch adjusts the degree of pitch-shifting applied to the feedback signal in semitones.
Diffusion controls the density of the algorithm’s reverb tail. Low values produce sparser tails,
while higher values produce denser tails. Turn this below 10% for dub-like delay effects. This is
very fun to use on drums!
Shimmer adjusts the intensity of the Shimmer effect. When set to 0%, no pitch shifting is applied;
the level of the pitched signal is progressively more present as the percentage is increased.
When used on melodic material, setting Shimmer to 100% produces interesting pitch
harmonizations.

In Shimmer mode, the Size knob adjusts the distance between individual echoes on percussive
material.

26.23.4.4 Tides

The Tides algorithm uses a smooth reverb while modulating the output’s spectrum with a multiband
filter, creating rippling frequency band effects.

In addition to the shared parameters listed above, Tides also provides the following:

•

•
•
•

•

Damping controls the amount of high-frequency filtering within the reverb algorithms. Higher
values result in darker reverberation sounds.
Wave morphs the filter modulation waveform from noise (0%) to sine (50%) to square (100%).
Tide adjusts the intensity of texture created by the modulation of the reverb tail.
Phase adjusts the amount of offset between the modulation waveforms for the left and right
channel. At 180°, the channels will be perfectly out of phase.
Rate sets the rate of the modulation oscillator in beat divisions with Triplet, 16th, and Dotted
note value variations.

26.23.4.5 Prism

The Prism algorithm is a bright, unique and artificial-sounding diffuse reverb based on velvet
(spectrally flat) noise. This algorithm can easily be used as a “ghost” reverb, adding depth without
interfering with the source material. It is well suited for non-linear short decays on drums and transient
material but can be also used on more sustained sounds with longer decays to achieve a clean yet
digital sound.

In addition to the shared parameters listed above, Prism also provides the following:

•
•
•

Low Mult scales the decay time of the low-end of the reverb tail.
High Mult scales the decay time of the high-end of the reverb tail.
X over controls the crossover frequency between the low-frequency and high-frequency
portions of the reverb tail, which in turn adjusts the frequency content affected by the Low Mult
and High Mult parameters.

Tip: For a classic ’80s-style gated snare reverb, use smaller Decay and Size values.

26.23.5 EQ Section

Hybrid Reverb’s EQ Section.

The EQ section of Hybrid Reverb is found in the second tab of the device’s display. You can quickly
activate or deactivate it by clicking on its toggle button in the tab.

By default, the EQ is placed after both reverb engines in the signal chain; however, by toggling the
Pre Algo button, you can place the EQ before the algorithmic reverb, regardless of which reverb
routing you have chosen.

Four bands of control are provided to further shape the reverb signal. The low and high bands can be
toggled between pass filters and shelving EQs. While in low-pass or high-pass mode, the filters
provide a range of slopes, from a gentle 6 dB/octave to a steep 96 dB/octave. The two middle peak
EQs can cover the entire frequency range and can be used for anything from wide-band boosting to
semi-narrow cuts.

26.23.6 Output Section

Hybrid Reverb’s output section contains a final set of parameters to shape the device’s overall sound.

Stereo sets the stereo width of the wet signal. 0% yields a mono signal whereas values above 100%
create a widened stereo panorama.

The Vintage slider increasingly degrades Hybrid Reverb’s sounds by emulating lower sample rates
and bit-depths, as is common in vintage digital reverberation devices. Four presets can be used to
radically alter the overall sound: Subtle, Old, Older, and Extreme.

Bass Mono converts frequencies lower than 180 Hz of Hybrid Reverb’s output signal to mono, which
helps to make bass frequencies sound tighter.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100%
when using Hybrid Reverb in a return track.
