# 26.2 Auto Filter

The Auto Filter Effect.

The Auto Filter effect provides classic analog filter emulation. It can be modulated by an envelope
follower and/or an LFO to create moving filter effects. The envelope follower can track either the
filtered signal or an external sidechain source.

Auto Filter offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a
special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 12 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection
of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware
filters found on some classic analog synthesizers.

The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ
Eight. This is available for all of the filter types.

The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping
diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all
filter types.

The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on
the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and
high-pass filters.

The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of
both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.

The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters
used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass
and high-pass filters.

The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance.
Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts
frequencies near that point.

When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is
an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the
filter.

The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-
pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.

You can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via
dedicated options in the context menu of the Morph knob.

You can adjust Frequency and Resonance by clicking and dragging in the X-Y controller or via the
knobs. You can also click on the Freq and Res numeric displays and type in exact values.

When using the non-Clean circuit types, the Resonance control allows for self-oscillation. At
Resonance values above 100%, the filter will continue to ring indefinitely even after the input signal
has been stopped. The pitch of the self-oscillation depends on both the Frequency and Resonance
values.

The Envelope section controls how the envelope modulation affects the filter frequency. The Amount
control defines the extent to which the envelope affects the filter frequency, while the Attack control
sets how the envelope responds to rising input signals. Low Attack values cause a fast response to
input levels; high values integrate any changes gradually, creating a looser, slower response. Think of
it as adding inertia to the response.

Lower Release values cause the envelope to respond more quickly to falling input signals. Higher
values extend the envelope’s decay.

Normally, the signal being filtered and the input source that triggers the envelope follower are the
same signal. But by using sidechaining, it is possible to filter a signal based on the envelope of
another signal. To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold the Auto Filter window by toggling the
button in its title bar.

Auto Filter’s Sidechain Parameters.

Enabling this section with the Sidechain button allows you to select another track from the choosers
below. This causes the selected track’s signal to trigger the filter’s envelope follower, instead of the
signal that is actually being filtered.

The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you
to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the envelope follower’s trigger. With Dry/
Wet at 100%, the envelope follower tracks the sidechain source exclusively. At 0%, the sidechain is
effectively bypassed. Note that increasing the gain does not increase the volume of the source signal
in the mix. The sidechain audio is only a trigger for the envelope follower and is never actually heard.

The Auto Filter also contains a Low Frequency Oscillator to modulate filter frequency in a periodic
fashion. The respective Amount control sets how much the LFO affects the filter. This can be used in
conjunction with or instead of the envelope follower.

The Rate control specifies the LFO speed. It can be set in terms of hertz, or synced to the song tempo,
allowing for controlled rhythmic filtering.

Available LFO waveform shapes are sine (creates smooth modulations with rounded peaks and
valleys), square, triangle, sawtooth up, sawtooth down, and sample and hold (generates random
positive and negative modulation values) in mono and stereo.

There are two LFOs, one for each stereo channel. The Phase and Offset controls define the relationship
between these two LFOs.

Phase keeps both LFOs at the same frequency, but can set the two LFO waveforms ”out of phase” with
each other, creating stereo movement. Set to ”180”, the LFO outputs are 180 degrees apart, so that
when one LFO reaches its peak, the other is at its minimum.

Spin detunes the two LFO speeds relative to each other. Each stereo channel is modulated at a
different frequency, as determined by the Spin amount.

For sample and hold (“S&H”), the Phase and Spin controls are not relevant and do not affect the
sound. Instead, the Auto Filter offers two kinds of sample and hold: The upper sample and hold type
available in the chooser provides independent random modulation generators for the left and right
channels (stereo), while the lower one modulates both channels with the same signal (mono).

The Quantize Beat control applies quantized modulation to the filter frequency. With Quantize Beat
off, frequency modulation follows the control source, e.g., the Envelope, LFO, or manually-adjusted
cutoff. Turning this feature on updates the filter modulation rhythmically with stepped changes that
track the tempo. The numbered buttons represent 16th notes, so, for example, selecting “4” as a beat
value produces a modulation change once per quarter note.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.
