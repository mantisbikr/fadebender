# 26.39.1 View Switches

The two buttons in the lower-left switch between Tuner’s two main views. Classic View resembles
conventional analog tuners while Histogram View shows pitch over time. In both views, the display
uses color to help indicate tuning accuracy. Green means in tune, while red means out of tune.
