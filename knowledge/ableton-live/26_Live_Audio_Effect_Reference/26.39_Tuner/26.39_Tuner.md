# 26.39 Tuner

The Tuner Device.

Tuner analyzes and displays the incoming monophonic pitch as well as its distance from the nearest
semitone. Based on classic guitar tuners, Tuner’s large display is designed for easy visibility on stage,
and is perfect for tuning external instruments or synthesizers.

It is important to note that Tuner is not an audio effect, but rather a measurement tool – it does not
alter the incoming signal in any way. Tuner is designed to analyze monophonic pitches, and works

best with a clean, clear signal. Polyphonic, noisy, or harmonically rich signals may yield inaccurate
results.

26.39.1 View Switches

The two buttons in the lower-left switch between Tuner’s two main views. Classic View resembles
conventional analog tuners while Histogram View shows pitch over time. In both views, the display
uses color to help indicate tuning accuracy. Green means in tune, while red means out of tune.

Tuner’s View Switches.

26.39.2 Classic View

In Classic View, the incoming pitch is represented as a colored ball along a curve, and the nearest
detected note name is shown in the center of the display. The arrows on either side of the note name
light up to indicate whether the signal needs to be tuned higher or lower in order to reach the desired
pitch.

In Target Mode, a circular outline in the center of the curve shows the desired pitch, and your signal is
in tune if the colored ball is exactly within this outline. If the incoming signal is sharp, the ball will
appear to the right of the target, while flat signals will appear to the left.

Tuner in Target Mode.

In Strobe Mode, the curve becomes a rotating band of lights. The direction of rotation indicates
whether the signal is sharp or flat. If the band rotates to the right, the incoming pitch is sharp, while flat
signals cause the band to rotate to the left. The further your signal is out of tune, the faster the band will
move.

The Hertz/Cents Switch toggles between showing the absolute frequency of the incoming signal in
Hertz or the distance from the target pitch in cents. This switch is also visible in the Histogram View.

26.39.3 Histogram View

In Histogram View, pitch is shown over time. The scale on the right of the display shows the possible
note names, and the horizontal gray bars represent the perfectly in-tune “center” of the associated
note. Sharp notes will appear above their corresponding gray line, while flat notes will appear below
it.

Drag up or down in the display to scroll to different pitches, or drag horizontally to zoom in or out.
With Auto enabled, the display will automatically adjust so that the incoming pitch is in the center of
the display.

The Hertz/Cents Switch toggles between showing the absolute frequency of the incoming signal in
Hertz or the distance from the target pitch in cents. This switch is also visible in the Classic View.

26.39.4 Note Spellings

Tuner’s Note Spellings.

The Tuner device includes three options for note spellings. You can access a menu with these options
when you right-click anywhere within Tuner’s view display:

•
•
•

Sharps (C#)
Flats (D♭)
Sharps and Flats (C#/D♭)

26.39.5 Reference Slider

Tuner’s Reference Slider.

The Reference slider allows you to change the tuning reference that Tuner uses when analyzing
incoming signals. By default this is set to 440 Hz, which is “standard” concert tuning, but it can be
changed to any value between 410-480 Hz.

26.40 Utility

The Utility Effect.

Utility can perform some very useful tasks, especially in combination with other devices.

There are two separate Phase controls, one for each input channel (Left and Right). As their names
imply, they invert the phase of each channel.

The Channel Mode chooser allows selective processing of the left and right channels of a sample. If,
for example, Left is selected, the right channel is ignored and the left channel appears on both
outputs. This is especially useful if you have a stereo file that contains different information on both
channels and you want to use only one.

The Width control sets the stereo width of the wet signal. 0% yields a mono signal whereas values
above 100% create a widened stereo panorama.

Choosing Mid/Side Mode from the Width control’s context menu allows you to you toggle between
the Width and Mid/Side controls. The Mid/Side control acts as a continuous mono to stereo
controller when set from 0 to 100M. Setting the parameter to 100M will sum the audio to mono.
Values between 0 and 100S emphasize the stereo or “out of phase” components of a signal. At
100S, only the side signal will be heard. The left and right channels will be 180 degrees out of phase
with each other.

Note that if either Left or Right have been chosen in the Channel Mode chooser, the Width and Mid/
Side controls have no function, and are therefore disabled.

When the Mono switch is enabled, the stereo input signal is converted to mono.

The Bass Mono switch converts the low frequencies of the input signal to mono. This is useful for
avoiding coloration of low frequencies when they are replayed in mono. You can use the Bass Mono
Frequency slider to adjust the cutoff frequency between 50-500 Hz.

When Bass Mono Audition is enabled, only the low frequencies can be heard. This can be useful for
tuning the Bass Mono Frequency.

The Gain control adjusts the level of the input signal from -infinite dB to +35 dB. This can be
particularly useful for automating volume fades on a track, while freeing up that track’s Volume control
for mix balancing. When adjusting the Gain parameter between -18 and +35 dB using the up and
down arrow keys, the value increases or decreases in 1 dB increments. However, between -18 dB
and -inf dB, the value smoothly accelerates.

The Balance control pans the signal anywhere in the stereo field.

The Mute button simply silences the incoming signal when enabled. The active/mute controls of a
track are always placed at the very end of the signal chain. However, since you can place Utility
anywhere in a signal chain, you can use its mute function to cut the input of a delay line or reverb
without turning off the output of these devices.

The DC switch filters out DC offsets and extremely low frequencies that are far below the audible
range. It will only have a sonic effect if a signal contains these frequencies and is processed after
Utility with nonlinear effects such as compressors or waveshapers.

26.41 Vinyl Distortion

The Vinyl Distortion Effect.

The Vinyl Distortion effect emulates some of the typical distortions that occur on vinyl records during
playback. These distortions are caused by the geometric relationships between the needle and the
recorded groove. The effect also features a crackle generator for adding noisy artifacts.

The Tracing Model section adds even harmonic distortion to the input signal. Adjust the amount of
distortion with the Drive knob, or click and drag vertically in the Tracing Model X-Y display. To adjust
the distortion’s frequency or ”color,” drag horizontally in the X-Y display or double-click on the Freq
field and type in a value. Holding the Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) modifier while dragging
vertically in the X-Y display changes the frequency band’s Q (bandwidth).

The Pinch Effect section adds odd harmonics to the input signal. These distortions typically occur 180
degrees out of phase, creating a richer stereo image. The Pinch Effect has the same controls as the
Tracing Model, but generates a rather different sound.

The Drive control increases or decreases the overall distortion amount created by both the Tracing
Model and Pinch.

There are two distortion modes: Soft and Hard. The Soft Mode simulates the sound of a dub plate,
while Hard Mode is more like that of a standard vinyl record.

The stereo/mono switch determines whether the Pinch distortion occurs in stereo or mono. Set it to
stereo for realistic simulation of vinyl distortions.

The Crackle section adds noise to the signal, with noise density set by the Density control. The Volume
control adjusts the amount of gain applied to the noise.
