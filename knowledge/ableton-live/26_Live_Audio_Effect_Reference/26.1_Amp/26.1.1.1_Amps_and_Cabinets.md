# 26.1.1.1 Amps and Cabinets

Guitar amps are designed to be used with accompanying speaker cabinets. For this reason, Amp
comes with a companion effect called Cabinet which is designed to be used after Amp in a device

chain. If you’re looking for authenticity, we recommend this signal flow. But you can also achieve
interesting and exotic sounds by using Amp and Cabinet independently.
