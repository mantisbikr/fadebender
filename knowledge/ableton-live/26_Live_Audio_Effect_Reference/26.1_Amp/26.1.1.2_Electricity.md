# 26.1.1.2 Electricity

The various circuits in guitar amps work with a continuous and fixed amount of electricity. For this
reason, turning up a particular parameter may inadvertently decrease the amount of available energy
somewhere else in the amp. This is particularly noticeable in the EQ controls. For example, turning up
Treble can reduce the level of bass and midrange frequencies. You may find that you need to carefully
adjust a number of seemingly unrelated parameters to get the results you want.
