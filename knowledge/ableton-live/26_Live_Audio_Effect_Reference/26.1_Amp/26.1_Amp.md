# 26.1 Amp

The Amp Effect.

Amp is an effect that emulates the sound and character of seven classic guitar amplifiers. Developed
in collaboration with Softube, Amp uses physical modelling technology to provide a range of
authentic and usable amplifier tones, with a simple and consistent set of controls.

There are seven amp models to choose from:

•

•
•

•

•
•

•

Clean is based on the ”Brilliant” channel of a classic amp from the ’60s. This amp was widely
used by guitarists of the British Invasion.
Boost is based on the ”Tremolo” channel of the same amp, and is great for edgy rock riffs.
Blues is based on a ’70s-era guitar amp with a bright character. This classic amp is popular
with country, rock and blues guitarists.
Rock is modeled after a classic 45 watt amp from the ’60s. This is perhaps the best known rock
amp of all time.
Lead is based on the ”Modern” channel of a high-gain amp popular with metal guitarists.
Heavy is based on the ”Vintage” channel of the same amp and is also ideal for metal and
grunge sounds.
Bass is modeled after a rare PA from the ’70s which has become popular with bass players due
to its strong low end and ”fuzz” at high volumes.

Although the real-world versions of these amplifiers all have unique parameters, Live’s Amp effect uses
the same set of controls for each model. This makes it very easy to quickly change the overall
character of your sound without having to make numerous adjustments.

Gain adjusts the level of input to the preamplifier, while Volume adjusts the output stage of the power
amplifier. Although Gain and Volume work together to determine Amp’s overall level, Gain is the
primary control for the distortion amount. Higher Gain settings result in a more distorted sound. When
using the Blues, Heavy and Bass models, high Volume levels can also add considerable distortion.

The Bass, Middle and Treble knobs are EQ controls that adjust the timbre of the sound. As on a real-
world amplifier, Amp’s EQ parameters interact with each other — and with the rest of Amp’s
parameters — in non-linear and sometimes unpredictable ways. For example, increasing EQ levels
can, in some cases, also increase the amount of distortion.

Presence is an additional tone control for mid/high frequencies in the power amp stage. Its influence
on the sound varies considerably depending on the amp model used but can add (or subtract)
”edge” or ”crispness.”

The Output switch toggles between mono and stereo (Dual) processing. Note that in Dual mode, Amp
uses twice as much CPU.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.

26.1.1 Amp Tips

Because Amp is modeled on real-world analog devices, its behavior can sometimes be difficult to
predict. Here are some tips on getting the most out of Amp:

26.1.1.1 Amps and Cabinets

Guitar amps are designed to be used with accompanying speaker cabinets. For this reason, Amp
comes with a companion effect called Cabinet which is designed to be used after Amp in a device

chain. If you’re looking for authenticity, we recommend this signal flow. But you can also achieve
interesting and exotic sounds by using Amp and Cabinet independently.

26.1.1.2 Electricity

The various circuits in guitar amps work with a continuous and fixed amount of electricity. For this
reason, turning up a particular parameter may inadvertently decrease the amount of available energy
somewhere else in the amp. This is particularly noticeable in the EQ controls. For example, turning up
Treble can reduce the level of bass and midrange frequencies. You may find that you need to carefully
adjust a number of seemingly unrelated parameters to get the results you want.

26.1.1.3 More than guitars

While Amp and Cabinet sound great with guitars, you can get very interesting results by feeding them
with drums, synthesizers or other sound sources. For example, try using Amp with Operator or Analog
to add analog grit to your digital sounds.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
