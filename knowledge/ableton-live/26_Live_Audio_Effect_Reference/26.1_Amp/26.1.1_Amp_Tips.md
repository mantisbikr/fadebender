# 26.1.1 Amp Tips

Because Amp is modeled on real-world analog devices, its behavior can sometimes be difficult to
predict. Here are some tips on getting the most out of Amp:

26.1.1.1 Amps and Cabinets

Guitar amps are designed to be used with accompanying speaker cabinets. For this reason, Amp
comes with a companion effect called Cabinet which is designed to be used after Amp in a device

chain. If you’re looking for authenticity, we recommend this signal flow. But you can also achieve
interesting and exotic sounds by using Amp and Cabinet independently.

26.1.1.2 Electricity

The various circuits in guitar amps work with a continuous and fixed amount of electricity. For this
reason, turning up a particular parameter may inadvertently decrease the amount of available energy
somewhere else in the amp. This is particularly noticeable in the EQ controls. For example, turning up
Treble can reduce the level of bass and midrange frequencies. You may find that you need to carefully
adjust a number of seemingly unrelated parameters to get the results you want.

26.1.1.3 More than guitars

While Amp and Cabinet sound great with guitars, you can get very interesting results by feeding them
with drums, synthesizers or other sound sources. For example, try using Amp with Operator or Analog
to add analog grit to your digital sounds.
