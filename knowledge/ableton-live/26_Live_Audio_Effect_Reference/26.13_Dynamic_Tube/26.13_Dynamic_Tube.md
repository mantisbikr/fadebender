# 26.13 Dynamic Tube

The Dynamic Tube Effect.

The Dynamic Tube effect infuses sounds with the peculiarities of tube saturation. An integrated
envelope follower generates dynamic tonal variations related to the level of the input signal.

Three tube models, A, B and C, provide a range of distortion characteristics known from real amplifier
tubes. Tube A does not produce distortions if Bias is set low, but will kick in whenever the input signal
exceeds a certain threshold, creating bright harmonics. Tube C is a very poor tube amp that produces
distortions all the time. The qualities of Tube B lie somewhere between these two extremes.

The Tone control sets the spectral distribution of the distortions, directing them into the higher registers,
or through the midrange and deeper.

The Drive control determines how much signal reaches the tube; greater Drive yields a dirtier output.
The intensity of the tube is controlled by the Bias dial, which pushes the signal into the celebrated
realms of nonlinear distortion. With very high amounts of Bias, the signal will really start to break
apart.

The Bias parameter can be positively or negatively modulated by an envelope follower, which is
controlled with the Envelope knob. The more deeply the envelope is applied, the more the Bias point
will be influenced by the level of the input signal. Negative Envelope values create expansion effects
by reducing distortion on loud signals, while positive values will make loud sounds dirtier.

Attack and Release are envelope characteristics that define how quickly the envelope reacts to
volume changes in the input signal. Together, they shape the dynamic nature of the distortions. Note
that if Envelope is set to zero, they will have no effect.

Cut or boost the device’s final signal level with the Output dial.

Aliasing can be reduced by enabling Hi-Quality mode, which can be accessed via the device title
bar’s context menu. This improves the sound quality, particularly with high frequency signals, but there
is a slight increase in CPU usage.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
