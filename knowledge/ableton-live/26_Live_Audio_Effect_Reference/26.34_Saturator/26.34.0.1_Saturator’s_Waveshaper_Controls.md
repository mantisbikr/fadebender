# 26.34.0.1 Saturator’s Waveshaper Controls

When you select the Waveshaper curve type, six additional parameters become active in the
expanded view.

The Waveshaper Controls.

The Waveshaper controls influence the device’s signal shaping functions in the following ways:

•

Drive determines how much the Waveshaper curve’s parameters affect the input signal. At 0%,
these parameters have no effect on the Waveshaper curve. At 100%, these parameters fully
shape the curve.

•
•

•

•

•

Curve adds mostly third-order harmonics to the input signal.
Depth controls the amplitude of a sine wave that is superimposed onto the Waveshaper curve.
Increasing the value raises the amplitude of the sine wave, making its effect on the shaping
curve more pronounced. At 0%, the sine wave has no influence.
Linear works with the Curve and Depth parameters to alter the linear portion of the
Waveshaper curve.
Damp flattens any signals near the center of the waveform. It functions like an ultra-fast noise
gate.
Period determines the density of ripples in the superimposed sine wave in relation to the Depth
control.
