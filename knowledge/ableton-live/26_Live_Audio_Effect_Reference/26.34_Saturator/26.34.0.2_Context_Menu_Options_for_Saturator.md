# 26.34.0.2 Context Menu Options for Saturator

Two additional modes can be enabled in Saturator’s context menu: Hi-Quality and Pre-DC Filter. The
Hi-Quality mode reduces aliasing and improves sound quality (especially with high frequency
signals), at the cost of a slight increase in CPU usage. The Pre-DC Filter mode activates a DC filter at
Saturator’s input stage, which is useful for removing DC offsets from audio that contains them.
