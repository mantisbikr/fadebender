# 26.17 Erosion

The Erosion Effect.

The Erosion effect degrades the input signal by modulating a short delay with filtered noise or a sine
wave. This adds noisy artifacts or aliasing/downsampling-like distortions that sound very ”digital.”

To change the sine wave frequency or noise band center frequency, click and drag along the X-axis in
the X-Y field. The Y-axis controls the modulation amount. If you hold down the Alt (Win) / Option
(Mac) modifier key while clicking in the X-Y field, the Y-axis controls the bandwidth. Note that
bandwidth is not adjustable when Sine is selected.

The Frequency control determines the color, or quality, of the distortion. If the Mode control is set to
Noise, this works in conjunction with the Width control, which defines the noise bandwidth. Lower
values lead to more selective distortion frequencies, while higher values affect the entire input signal.
Width has no effect in Sine Mode.

Noise and Sine use a single modulation generator. However, Wide Noise has independent noise
generators for the left and right channels, which creates a subtle stereo enhancement.

26.18 External Audio Effect

The External Audio Effect.

The External Audio Effect is a bit different than Live’s other effects devices. Instead of processing audio
itself, it allows you to use external (hardware) effects processors within a track’s device chain.

The Audio To chooser selects the outputs on your computer’s audio hardware that will go to your
external device, while the Audio From chooser selects the inputs that will bring the processed signal
back into Live. As with the track inputs and outputs, the list of available inputs and outputs depends on
the Audio Settings, which can be reached via the ”Configure…” option at the bottom of each chooser.

Below each chooser is a Peak level indicator that shows the highest audio level attained. Click on the
indicators to reset them.

The Gain knobs next to the choosers adjust the levels going out of and back into Live. These levels
should be set carefully to avoid clipping, both in your external hardware and when returning the
audio to your computer.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100
percent if using the External Audio Effect in a return track.

The Invert button inverts the phase of the processed signal coming back into Live.

Since hardware effects introduce latency that Live cannot automatically detect, you can manually
compensate for any delays by adjusting the Hardware Latency slider. The button next to this slider
allows you to set your latency compensation amount in either milliseconds or samples. If your external
device connects to Live via a digital connection, you will want to adjust your latency settings in

samples, which ensures that the number of samples you specify will be retained even when changing
the sample rate. If your external device connects to Live via an analog connection, you will want to
adjust your latency settings in milliseconds, which ensures that the amount of time you specify will be
retained when changing the sample rate. Note that adjusting in samples gives you finer control, so
even in cases when you’re working with analog devices, you may want to ”fine tune” your latency in
samples in order to achieve the lowest possible latency. In this case, be sure to switch back to
milliseconds before changing your sample rate.

Note: If the Delay Compensation option is unchecked in the Options menu, the Hardware Latency
slider is disabled.

For instructions on how to accurately set up latency compensation for your hardware, please see the
Driver Error Compensation lesson in Live’s Help View.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
