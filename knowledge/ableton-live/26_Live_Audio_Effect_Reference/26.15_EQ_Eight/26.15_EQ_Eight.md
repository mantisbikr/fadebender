# 26.15 EQ Eight

The EQ Eight Effect.

The EQ Eight effect is an equalizer featuring up to eight parametric filters per input channel, useful for
changing a sound’s timbre.

The input signal can be processed using one of three modes: Stereo, L/R and M/S. Stereo mode uses
a single curve to filter both channels of a stereo input equally. L/R mode provides an independently
adjustable filter curve for the left and right channels of a stereo input; M/S mode (Mid/Side)
provides the same functionality for signals that have been recorded using M/S encoding. In all
modes, the frequency spectrum of the output is displayed behind the filter curves when the Analyze
switch is on.

When using the L/R and M/S modes, both curves are displayed simultaneously for reference,
although only the active channel is editable. The Edit switch indicates the active channel, and is used
to toggle between the two curves.

Each filter has a chooser that allows you to switch between eight responses. From top to bottom in the
choosers, these are:

•
•
•
•
•
•

48 or 12 dB/octave Low cut (cuts frequencies below the specified frequency);
Low shelf (boosts or cuts frequencies lower than the specified frequency);
Peak (boosts or cuts over a range of frequencies);
Notch (sharply cuts frequencies within a narrow range);
High shelf (boosts or cuts frequencies higher than the specified frequency);
12 or 48 dB/octave High cut (cuts frequencies above the specified frequency).

Each filter band can be turned on or off independently with an activator switch below the chooser.
Turn off bands that are not in use to save CPU power. To achieve really drastic filtering effects, assign
the same parameters to two or more filters.

To edit the filter curve, click and drag on the filter dots in the display. Drag-enclose multiple filter dots
to adjust them simultaneously, either with the mouse or with your computer keyboard’s arrow keys.
Horizontal movement changes the filter frequency, while vertical movement adjusts the filter band’s
gain. To adjust the filter Q (also called resonance or bandwidth), hold down the Alt (Win) /
Option (Mac) modifier while dragging the mouse. Note that the gain cannot be adjusted for the low
cut, notch and high cut filters. In these modes, vertical dragging adjusts the filter Q.

To get an even better view, you can toggle the location of the display between the device chain and
Live’s main window by clicking the
 button in EQ Eight’s title bar. When using this expanded view,
all eight filters can be edited simultaneously in the Device View.

EQ Eight’s Controls With the Display Expanded.

By default, EQ Eight’s output spectrum is shown in the display. If you would prefer to work entirely “by
ear,” you can turn off the Analyze button to disable the spectrum view.

With Adaptive Q enabled, the Q amount increases as the amount of boost or cut increases. This
results in a more consistent output volume and is based on the behavior of classic analog EQs.

To temporarily solo a single filter, enable Audition mode via the headphone icon. In Audition mode,
clicking and holding on a filter dot allows you to hear only that filter’s effect on the output.

You can also select a band for editing by clicking near its number and then edit parameter values with
the Freq, Gain and Q dials (and/or type values into the number fields below each dial).

As boosting will increase levels and cutting will decrease levels, use the global Gain slider to optimize
the output level for maximum level consistent with minimum distortion.

The Scale field will adjust the gain of all filters that support gain (all except low cut, notch and high
cut).

26.15.0.1 Context Menu Options for EQ Eight

Several of EQ Eight’s controls are only available via the device title bar’s context menu. These include:

•

Oversampling - enabling this option causes EQ Eight to internally process two times the current
sample rate, which allows for smoother filter behavior when adjusting high frequencies. There is
a slight increase in CPU usage with Oversampling enabled.

26.16 EQ Three

The EQ Three Effect.

If you have ever used a good DJ mixer you will know what this is: An EQ that allows you to adjust the
level of low, mid and high frequencies independently.

Each band can be adjusted from -infinite dB to +6 dB using the gain controls. This means that you can
completely remove, for example, the bass drum or bassline of a track, while leaving the other
frequencies untouched.

You can also turn on or off each band using the On/Off buttons located under the gain controls.
These buttons are especially handy if assigned to computer keys.

EQ Three gives you visual confirmation of the presence of a signal in each frequency band using three
LEDs. Even if a band is turned off, you can tell if there is something going on in it. The internal threshold
for the LEDs is set to -24 dB.

The frequency range of each band is defined via two crossover controls: FreqLo and FreqHi. If FreqLo
is set to 500 Hz and FreqHi to 2000 Hz, then the low band goes from 0 Hz to 500 Hz, the mid band
from 500 Hz to 2000 Hz and the high band from 2000 Hz up to whatever your soundcard or
sample rate supports.

A very important control is the 24 dB/48 dB switch. It defines how sharp the filters are cutting the
signal at the crossover frequency. The higher setting results in more drastic filtering, but needs more
CPU.

Note: The filters in this device are optimized to sound more like a good, powerful analog filter
cascade than a clean digital filter. The 48 dB Mode especially does not provide a perfect linear
transfer quality, resulting in a slight coloration of the input signal even if all controls are set to 0.00 dB.
This is typical behavior for this kind of filter, and is part of EQ Three’s unique sound. If you need a
more linear behavior choose 24 dB Mode or use the EQ Eight.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
