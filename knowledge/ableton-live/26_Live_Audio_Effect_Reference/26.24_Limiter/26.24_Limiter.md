# 26.24 Limiter

The Limiter Effect.

The Limiter effect is a mastering-quality dynamic range processor that ensures that the output does not
exceed a specified level. Limiter is ideal for use on the Main track, to prevent clipping in digital-to-
analog converters. A limiter is essentially a compressor with an infinite ratio. For more information
about compression theory, refer to the Compressor section.

Limiter’s display contains the Ceiling control and the Gain Reduction meter. The Ceiling control sets the
absolute maximum level that Limiter will output. If your incoming signal level has no peaks that are
higher than the ceiling, no limiting will be applied by the device.

The Gain Reduction meter shows the amount of gain reduction being applied when the signal reaches
the ceiling or threshold.

The Link control defines how much of the gain reduction applied by Limiter is shared across its two
channels. These can be the left/right channels or the mid/side channels, depending on which Routing
Mode is selected. When set to 100%, limiting is applied to both channels whenever either requires
compression, ensuring a stable stereo image. When set to 0%, the channels are processed
independently, with different gain reduction applied to each channel. This can be useful when
working with signals where the left and right channels are separate, or to achieve creative effects,
such as a “wobble” in the stereo image.

You can use the Input Gain knob to the left of the display to boost or attenuate the incoming signal
level before limiting is applied to it.

Switching on the Maximize toggle below the Input Gain knob changes the Ceiling control to
Threshold, which allows you to adjust the signal’s dynamic range and loudness with a single control.
Lowering the Threshold amplifies the limiter stage output by the inverse of the Threshold value. Note
that the Input Gain knob becomes the Output control when Maximize is on, and sets the target output
level for the device.

The Release knob adjusts how long it takes for the device to stop applying limiting after the signal falls
below the ceiling or threshold. Fast release times make the output sound louder and punchier, while
slow release times add smoothness, though can also reduce the dynamic range. The Gain Reduction
meter helps to visualize the effect of the Release control: at faster release times you will see the meter
return to zero more quickly, while at slower release times the meter recovers more gradually, and
Limiter maintains compression for a longer time.

You can use the Auto toggle beneath the Release knob to activate auto-release. When on, Limiter
analyzes incoming audio and continuously updates its release time based on the signal’s
characteristics. Note that when auto-release is enabled, the Release control is deactivated.

The Lookahead control to the right of the display allows you to adjust the setting that determines how
quickly Limiter will respond to peaks that require compression. The lookahead time can be set to 1.5,
3, or 6 milliseconds. Shorter lookahead times allow for more compression but can increase distortion,
especially when applied to bass sounds. As the lookahead time affects Limiter’s attack time, longer
lookahead values are useful for catching very fast peaks. Note that lookahead introduces latency: the
longer the lookahead time, the higher the latency.

The Ceiling Mode toggles let you choose between three ceiling modes: Standard, Soft Clip, and True
Peak. Standard is the device’s default mode. Soft Clip introduces soft clipping when signals approach
the device’s ceiling level, which can add subtle color and punch to transients. When Soft Clip is on, an
LED appears above the mode toggles, and flashes to indicate that the signal is clipping. Finally, the
True Peak mode prevents inter-sample peaks.

You can use the Routing Mode toggles to determine how Limiter treats peaks that occur on only one
side of the stereo signal. In L/R mode, the left and right channels of the signal are compressed
independently. This allows the device to apply more compression, but with some distortion of the
stereo image. In M/S mode, Limiter encodes the signal to mid/side before the limiting stage, then
decodes it to stereo at the output stage. This can be useful for preserving the signal’s stereo image, but
results in higher latency.

Note that adding any further processing effects after Limiter may add gain. To ensure that your final
output will never clip, place Limiter as the last device in the Main track’s device chain and keep the
Main track’s volume below 0 dB.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
