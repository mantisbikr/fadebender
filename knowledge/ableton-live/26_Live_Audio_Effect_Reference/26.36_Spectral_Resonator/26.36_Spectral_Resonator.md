# 26.36 Spectral Resonator

The Spectral Resonator Effect.

Based on spectral processing, Spectral Resonator uses spectral resonances and pitched overtones to
add tonal character to any audio source. You can highlight chosen frequencies of the resonating
partials and alter their decay, creating either short percussive reverberations or long washed-out
tones. Choose which frequencies are affected through an internal resonator or via an external MIDI
sidechain. Similar to a vocoder, you can use the MIDI input to place the resonances in key with its

surrounding musical elements, playing the effect polyphonically with up to 16 voices. Spectral
Resonator also offers several spectral processing types on the input signal, including spectral filtering,
spectral chorus, and granularization.

Spectral Resonator uses a spectrogram to display how frequencies in the dry and wet signals behave
over time. Dry signals are represented in yellow, while wet signals are shown in blue. You can hide the
visualization by clicking on its toggle button.

On the left side of the device, you will find the Pitch Mode section. Different controls are available
depending on whether Internal mode or MIDI mode is selected.

When Internal mode is enabled, Spectral Resonator will be tuned to the frequency set by the Freq dial.
The frequency can be set either in Hertz or to a specific pitch; to toggle between the two options, use
the Frequency Dial Mode buttons. Note that the MIDI mode controls are disabled in Internal mode.

When MIDI mode is enabled, Spectral Resonator can be tuned to the frequencies of incoming MIDI
notes. When MIDI mode is enabled, the MIDI router, Mono/Poly switch, Polyphony control, MIDI
Gate, Glide and Pitch Bend range controls are also enabled.

The MIDI router allows you to choose any MIDI track as a source. To use an external MIDI controller,
use the “MIDI From” chooser on any MIDI track to select your MIDI controller. Then, in Spectral
Resonator, choose the track with the selected MIDI controller in the “MIDI From” drop-down chooser.

The MIDI input can be transposed using the Transpose dial (displayed as “Transp. “) with a range of
+/- 48 semitones.

The Mono/Poly switch enables polyphony for incoming MIDI, enabling you to send polyphonic
material such as chords to Spectral Resonator. You can choose between 2, 4, 8, or 16 voices in the
Polyphony chooser. The number of harmonics set by the Harmonics control are evenly distributed
between the voices, resulting in fewer harmonics per voice when high voice counts are used. The
combination of high Polyphony and Unison values will create a darker sound.

When the MIDI Gate button is deactivated, audio input will still excite the resonator, even when no
MIDI notes are playing. When activated, the device behaves more like an instrument, and will only
resonate while MIDI notes are being played. In Polyphonic mode, MIDI Gate is always active, so you
will need to play MIDI notes to produce sound.

The Glide parameter adjusts the time in milliseconds over which it takes notes to slide their pitch to the
next incoming pitch. Note that this is only active in Mono mode. The PB parameter defines the effect of
MIDI pitch bend messages, allowing a range of 0-24 semitones. Note that Spectral Resonator is also
able to receive MPE.

The Harmonics parameter (in the upper right corner of the spectrogram) changes the number of
harmonics. More harmonics will lead to a brighter sound and fewer to a darker sound. Note also that
a higher number of harmonics increases the CPU usage.

Stretch increases or decreases the spacing between the harmonics. Values below 0 will compress the
distance, while values above 0 will stretch it. At 100%, only odd harmonics are created, which leads
to a square-wave type sound.

Shift transposes the input signal’s spectrum up or down within a range of +/- 48 semitones. Note that
this does not shift the spectrum of the actual effect, but rather the spectrum of the signal which is fed to
the effect.

Decay adjusts the decay time in milliseconds. A higher value leads to sustained tones. HF Damp sets
the amount of damping applied to high frequency partials. LF Damp sets the amount of damping
applied to low frequency partials.

For both HF Damp and LF Damp, the frequencies affected by the control shift with the pitch of the Freq
knob (when in Internal mode), or with any incoming MIDI notes (when in MIDI mode).

Using the available switches, you can choose between four Modulations Modes: None, Chorus,
Wander, and Granular. These modes determine how each individual harmonic’s pitch and amplitude
are modulated:

•
•

•
•

None applies no modulation.
Chorus applies triangle wave modulation for every partial. When Mod Rate is set to 0, this
mode only modulates the amplitudes of the partials.
Wander uses random sawtooth waveforms as the modulation source for each partial.
Granular modulates the amplitude of all partials randomly, using exponential decay envelopes.
The partials are generated at random and, in this mode, the Mod Rate parameter affects the
density of the partials.

Both Wander and Granular modes will affect each individual Unison voice, creating very warbly,
dense and indistinct sounds.

All Modulation Modes are also affected by the Mod Rate and Pch. Mod (pitch modulation)
parameters. Mod Rate sets the modulation rate, while Pch. Mod adjusts the range of pitch modulation
in semitones. Though Pch. Mod displays only a positive value, pitch modulation is applied in both a
positive and negative direction (except in Granular mode, where the grain envelopes are only
applied in a positive direction).

The Input Send dial sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal. There is also a built-in
limiter, to ensure that no signal gets too loud. The LED next to the Input Send dial will light up if the
limiter is in use.

The Unison parameter allows you to choose 1, 2, 4, or 8 voices, while Unison Amount (displayed as
“Uni. Amt”) adjusts the intensity of the unison effect. A higher Unison value increases the number of
voices, and increasing the Unison Amount causes the voices to become further detuned from each
other.

The Dry/Wet adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals and modifies the visibility of
the two signals in the spectrogram. Set Dry/Wet to 100% when using Spectral Resonator in a return
track.

26.36.1 Spectral Resonator Tips

Here are some tips for using Spectral Resonator:

•

•

•

•

•

Create tonal drum loops by placing Spectral Resonator on a drum track and using the MIDI
sidechain input to feed specific pitches to Spectral Resonator. This can be used to add rhythm to
your track with the same pitches as your bass, for example.
In order to have Spectral Resonator follow the pitches of melodic material, first use the Convert
Harmony to New MIDI Track or the Convert Melody to New MIDI Track command, then send
the generated MIDI track to Spectral Resonator.
Create reverb-type sounds by setting Frequency to a low value, setting Unison and Unison
Amount to a high value, and use the Wander modulation mode in combination with low Mod
Rate and Pch. Mod values. Adjust the Decay parameter to make the “reverb” decay longer or
shorter.
Vocal processing - Spectral Resonator can be used like a vocoder by simply using your voice
as the audio to be processed in combination with the MIDI sidechain input.
Use two Spectral Resonators in series to create overlapping harmonics by sending different
MIDI signals to each of the Spectral Resonators.
