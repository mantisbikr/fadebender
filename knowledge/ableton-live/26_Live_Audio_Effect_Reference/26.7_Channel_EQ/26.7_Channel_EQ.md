# 26.7 Channel EQ

The Channel EQ Effect.

Inspired by EQs found on classic mixing desks, Channel EQ is a simple, yet flexible three-band EQ,
fine-tuned to provide musical results for a variety of audio material.

Activating the HP 80 Hz switch will toggle a high-pass filter, which is useful for removing the rumble
from a signal.

The Low parameter controls the gain of a low shelf filter, tuned to 100 Hz. This filter can boost or
attenuate low frequencies by a range of +/- 15 dB. The filter curve is adaptive and will change
dynamically relative to the amount of gain applied.

The Mid parameter controls the gain of a sweepable peak filter. Unlike the Low and High parameters,
Mid has a range of +/- 12 dB. The frequency slider located above the Mid control allows you to set
the center frequency of this filter from 120 Hz to 7.5 kHz.

When boosting, the High parameter controls the gain of a high shelf filter, up to 15 dB. When
attenuating, the shelving filter is combined with a low-pass filter. Turning the parameter from 0 dB
towards -15 dB will simultaneously reduce the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter from 20 kHz to 8
kHz.

A spectrum visualization provides real-time visual feedback of the resulting filter curves and processed
signal.

The Output control sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal, and can be used to
compensate for any changed signal amplitude resulting from the EQ settings.

26.7.1 Channel EQ Tips

You can use Channel EQ to further shape the output of a reverb effect in a device chain.

You can also shape the sound of a single drum or an entire drum kit, by placing an instance of
Channel EQ onto one or multiple Drum Rack pads.

Adding an instance of Saturator after Channel EQ in a device chain allows you to simulate the
analog nonlinearities of a mixer channel strip. In such cases, boosting the low end considerably
would also lead to increased distortion, similar to the behavior of analog mixing desks.

26.8 Chorus-Ensemble

The Chorus-Ensemble Effect.

Chorus-Ensemble offers a classic two-delay line chorus with an optional third delay line mode. With a
wide variety of tools for thickening sounds, creating flanging and vibrato effects, this device also
allows you to easily recreate string ensemble chorus sounds.

Three different modes are provided, which can be chosen in the display: Classic, Ensemble, and
Vibrato.

Classic mode creates a thickened sound by adding two time-modulated delayed signals to the input.
Use it for a classic chorus sound, adding light motion to your audio signal.

Ensemble mode is inspired by a thick three-delay line chorus pedal used in the ’70s. Ensemble mode
is based on and shares controls with Classic mode, but creates richer, smoother, and more intense
chorus sound by using three delayed signals with evenly split modulation phase offsets.

Vibrato mode applies stronger modulation than a chorus to create pitch variation. The shape of the
modulation waveform can morph seamlessly from a sine to a triangle, and be used to create well-
known “police siren” sounds.

In addition to the mode selector buttons, the display also provides access to a high-pass filter and the
Width parameter. Width is active in Classic and Ensemble modes, but while in Vibrato mode, this
parameter is replaced by Offset and Shape controls.

When enabled, the high-pass filter reduces the chorus effect on signal components below the
frequency set by the High-Pass Frequency slider, ranging from 20 Hz to 2000 Hz.

Width sets the stereo width of the wet signal, which in turn adjusts the chorus level balance between
the mid and side channels. At 0% the signal will be mono, at 100% the balance is equal, and at
200% the chorus level is twice as loud in the sides as in the middle. This is used for maintaining the
level of the effect across the stereo field, which can be helpful during mixing.

When using Vibrato mode, Offset adjusts the amount of phase offset between the waveforms for the
left and right channel. At 180°, the channels will be perfectly out of phase. Shape enables you to
change the shape of the modulation waveform between a sine and a triangle.

Global parameters available include Rate, Amount, Feedback, Output, Warmth and Dry/Wet.

Rate sets the modulation rate in Hertz, and can be adjusted either with the dial or by dragging up or
down in the display. Turn up Rate for a more drastic chorus sound, or keep it low for more gentle
phasing.

Amount adjusts the amplitude of the modulation signals that affects delay times. Higher values result in
a stronger time deviation from the unmodulated time setting.

Feedback sets the amount of each channel’s output that is fed back to its input. Increasing this sounds
more extreme and tends to increase upper harmonic material, and will also create audible delays if
playback is stopped. The feedback signal can be inverted using the Ø button, which results in a
“hollow” sound when combined with high feedback values.

Output sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal.

Warmth adds slight distortion and filtering for a warmer sound. Turn it up for more crunch!

Dry/Wet adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100% when using
Chorus-Ensemble in a return track. Note that this is disabled in Vibrato mode.

26.8.1 Chorus-Ensemble Tips

Here are some tips for using Chorus-Ensemble:

•

•

Use Ensemble mode at a rate between 1 Hz and 1.8 Hz and 100% Amount on dry guitars to
create a typical surf-rock sound.
Automate the Feedback Invert toggle at Feedback levels > 90% to create massive bursts of
decaying oscillations.

26.9 Compressor

The Compressor Effect.

A compressor reduces gain for signals above a user-settable threshold. Compression reduces the
levels of peaks, opening up more headroom and allowing the overall signal level to be turned up. This
gives the signal a higher average level, resulting in a sound that is subjectively louder and ”punchier”
than an uncompressed signal.

A compressor’s two most important parameters are the Threshold and the compression Ratio.

The Threshold slider sets where compression begins. Signals above the threshold are attenuated by an
amount specified by the Ratio parameter, which sets the ratio between the input and output signal. For
example, with a compression ratio of 3, if a signal above the threshold increases by 3 dB, the
compressor output will increase by only 1 dB. If a signal above the threshold increases by 6 dB, then
the output will increase by only 2 dB. A ratio of 1 means no compression, regardless of the threshold.

The orange Gain Reduction meter shows how much the gain is being reduced at any given moment.
The more reduction, the more audible the effect; a gain reduction above 6 dB or so might produce the
desired loudness, but significantly alters the sound and is easily capable of destroying its dynamic
structure. This is something that cannot be undone in later production steps. Keep this in mind
especially when using a compressor, limiter, or sound loudness-maximizing tool in the Main track.
Less is often more here.

Because compression reduces the volume of loud signals and opens up headroom, you can use the
Output (Out) control so that the peaks once again hit the maximum available headroom. The Output
meter shows the output signal’s level. Enabling the Makeup button automatically compensates the
output level if the threshold and ratio settings change.

Dry/Wet adjusts the balance between the compressed and uncompressed signals. At 100%, only the
compressed signal is heard, while at 0%, the device is effectively bypassed.

The Knee control adjusts how gradually or abruptly compression occurs as the threshold is
approached. With a setting of 0 dB, no compression is applied to signals below the threshold, and full
compression is applied to any signal at or above the threshold. With very high ratios, this so-called
”hard knee” behavior can sound harsh. With higher (or ”soft”) knee values, the compressor begins
compressing gradually as the threshold is approached. For example, with a 10 dB knee and a -20 dB
threshold, subtle compression will begin at -30 dB and increase so that signals at -10 dB will be fully
compressed.

Compressor’s display can be switched between several modes via switches in the bottom corners of
the display:

•

The Collapsed view shows only the essential controls.

Compressor’s Collapsed View.

•

The Transfer Curve shows the input level on the horizontal axis and output level vertically. This
view is useful for setting the Knee parameter, which is visible as a pair of dotted lines around
the threshold.

Compressor’s Transfer Curve.

•

The Activity view shows the level of the input signal in light gray. In this mode, the GR and
Output switches toggle between showing the amount of gain reduction in orange or the output
level in a darker gray. These views are useful for visualizing what’s happening to the signal over
time.

Compression Activity Display, Showing Input and Output.

The Attack and Release controls are essential parameters for controlling the response time of
Compressor by defining how fast it reacts to input-level changes.

Attack defines how long it takes to reach maximum compression once a signal exceeds the threshold,
while Release sets how long it takes for the compressor to return to normal operation after the signal
falls below the threshold. With Auto Release enabled, the release time will adjust automatically based
on the incoming audio.

A slight amount of attack time (10-50 ms) allows peaks to come through unprocessed, which helps
preserve dynamics by accentuating the initial portion of the signal. If these peaks cause overloads,
you can try shortening the attack time, but extremely short times take the ”life” out of the signal, and
may lead to a slight “buzziness” caused by distortion. Short release times can cause ”pumping” as
the compressor tries to figure out whether to compress or not; while generally considered an
undesirable effect, some engineers use it on full drum kits to give unusual ”sucking” effects. Careful
adjustment of attack and release times is essential when it comes to compression of rhythmical
sources. If you are not used to working with compressors, play a drum loop and spend some time
adjusting Attack, Release, Threshold and Gain. It can be very exciting!

A compressor can only react to an input signal once it occurs. Since it also needs to apply an attack/
release envelope, the compression is always a bit too late. A digital compressor can solve this
problem by simply delaying the input signal a little bit. Compressor offers three different Lookahead
times: zero ms, one ms and ten ms. The results may sound pretty different depending on this setting.

Compressor can be switched between three basic modes of operation. With Peak selected,
Compressor reacts to short peaks within a signal. This mode is more aggressive and precise, and so
works well for limiting tasks where you need to ensure that there are absolutely no signals over the set
threshold. RMS mode causes Compressor to be less sensitive to very short peaks and compress only
when the incoming level has exceeded the threshold for a slightly longer time. RMS is closer to how
people actually perceive loudness and is usually considered more musical. Expand mode lets you set
the ratio of expansion between the input and output level. For example, a ratio of 1 to 2 means that
for every 1 dB of input above the threshold level, the output level will increase by 2 dB. A ratio of 1 to
1 results in no expansion. For more information about the various types of dynamics processing, see
the Multiband Dynamics section.

In addition to these modes, Compressor can be switched between two envelope follower shapes that
offer further options for how the device measures and responds to signal levels. In linear (Lin) mode,
the speed of the compression response is determined entirely by the Attack and Release values. In
logarithmic (Log) mode, sharply compressed peaks will have a faster release time than less
compressed material. This can result in smoother and less noticeable compression than Lin mode.
Note that the Lin/Log switch is not visible in Compressor’s collapsed view.

26.9.1 Sidechain Parameters

The Compressor Device With Sidechain Section.

Normally, the signal being compressed and the input source that triggers the compressor are the same
signal. But by using sidechaining, it is possible to compress a signal based on the level of another
signal or a specific frequency component. To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold the
Compressor window by toggling the

 button in its title bar.

The sidechain parameters are divided into two sections. On the left are the external controls. Enabling
this section with the Sidechain button allows you to select any of Live’s internal routing points from the
choosers below. This causes the selected source to act as the compressor’s trigger, instead of the
signal that is actually being compressed.

The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you
to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the compressor’s trigger. With Dry/Wet at
100%, the compressor is triggered entirely by the sidechain source. At 0%, the sidechain is effectively
bypassed. Note that increasing the gain does not increase the volume of the source signal in the mix.
The sidechain audio is only a trigger for the compressor and is never actually heard.

Note that automatic Makeup is not available when using external sidechain.

On the right of the external section are the controls for the sidechain EQ. Enabling this section causes
the compressor to be triggered by a specific band of frequencies, instead of a complete signal. These
can either be frequencies in the compressed signal or, by using the EQ in conjunction with an external
sidechain, frequencies in another track’s audio.

The headphones button between the external and EQ sections allows you to listen to only the
sidechain input, bypassing the compressor’s output. Since the sidechain audio isn’t fed to the output,
and is only a trigger for the compressor, this temporary listening option can make it much easier to set
sidechain parameters and hear what’s actually making the compressor work.

26.9.2 Compressor Tips

This section presents some tips for using Compressor effectively, particularly with the sidechain
options.

26.9.2.1 Mixing a Voiceover

Sidechaining is commonly used for so-called ”ducking” effects. For example, imagine that you have
one track containing a voiceover and another track containing background music. Since you want the
voiceover to always be the loudest source in the mix, the background music must get out of the way
every time the narrator is speaking. To do this automatically, insert a Compressor on the music track,
but select the narration track’s output as the external sidechain source.

26.9.2.2 Sidechaining in Dance Music

Sidechaining/ducking is a dance music producer’s secret weapon because it can help to ensure that
basslines (or even whole mixes) always make room for the kick drum. By inserting a compressor on

the bass (or Main) track and using the kick drum’s track as the sidechain input, you can help to control
problematic low frequencies that might interfere with the kick drum’s attack.

Using the sidechain EQ in conjunction with this technique can create ducking effects even if you only
have a mixed drum track to work with (as opposed to an isolated kick drum). In this case, insert the
Compressor on the track you want to duck. Then choose the drum track as the external sidechain
source. Then enable the sidechain EQ and select the low-pass filter. By carefully adjusting the
Frequency and Q settings, you should be able to isolate the kick drum from the rest of the drum mix.
Using the sidechain listen mode can help you tune the EQ until you find settings you’re happy with.

Note that Compressor’s internal algorithms were updated in Live 9, in collaboration with Dr. Joshua D.
Reiss of the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London.
