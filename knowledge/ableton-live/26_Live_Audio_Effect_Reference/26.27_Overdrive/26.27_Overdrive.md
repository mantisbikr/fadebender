# 26.27 Overdrive

The Overdrive Effect.

Overdrive is a distortion effect that pays homage to some classic pedal devices commonly used by
guitarists. Unlike many distortion units, it can be driven extremely hard without sacrificing dynamic
range.

The distortion stage is preceded by a band-pass filter that can be controlled with an X-Y controller. To
define the filter bandwidth, click and drag on the vertical axis. To set the position of the frequency
band, click and drag on the horizontal axis. These parameters can also be set via the slider boxes
below the X-Y display.

The Drive control sets the amount of distortion. Note that 0% does not mean zero distortion!

Tone acts as a post-distortion EQ control. At higher values, the signal has more high-frequency
content.

The Dynamics slider allows you to adjust how much compression is applied as the distortion is
increased. At low settings, higher distortion amounts result in an increase in internal compression and
make-up gain. At higher settings, less compression is applied.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100
percent if using Overdrive in a return track.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
