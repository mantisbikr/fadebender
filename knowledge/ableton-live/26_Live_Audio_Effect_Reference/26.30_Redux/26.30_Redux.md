# 26.30 Redux

The Redux Effect.

The Redux effect has a variety of parameters for creating a wide range of jagged and edgy sounds.
You can radically mangle any source material, with effects ranging from harsh distortion and digital
aliasing artifacts to warm, fat 8-bit grit. Extra noise and stereo width can be added to the
downsampling process, while filtering further transforms the sound. The quantizer’s amplitude curve
can also be changed to allow both subtle and drastic bitcrushing.

Redux makes use of two different digital signal manipulation techniques: downsampling and bit
reduction.

26.30.1 Downsampling

The downsampling controls are available on the left side of the device. Using Redux’s downsampler
without any filters engaged introduces inharmonic frequency content into the spectrum. The frequency
range of the added content is dependent upon the relationship between the frequency content of the
material and the sample rate chosen in the device.

Rate sets the sample rate to which the signal is degraded. Lower values result in increased imaging
and more inharmonic tones.

Jitter adds noise to the downsampler’s clock signal, which introduces randomness to the
downsampling process. This results in a noisier sound, as well as increased stereo width.

The Filter section has both a Pre and a Post setting. Enabling the Pre button engages a filter before
downsampling, which reduces the bandwidth of the signal processed by downsampling. When Jitter
is in use, it also reduces the stereo width of the signal.

The Post button engages a low-pass filter after the downsampling process, which reduces imaging.
The Post filter frequency can be adjusted using the Post-Filter Octave slider. The number shown
represents the number of octaves above or below half of the frequency shown in the Rate parameter.

26.30.2 Bit Reduction

The bit reduction controls are available on the right side of the device. Bit reduction decreases the
number of bits used to represent the digital signal, reducing dynamic range while adding distortion
and noise. At extreme settings, all original dynamics are lost and sounds are reduced to jagged
square waves.

The Bits control reduces the number of bits being used. The value shown represents the number of bits
used to encode the output signal. Reducing this value increases noise and distortion while reducing
dynamic range.

Shape varies the shape of the quantizer’s characteristic curve. Higher values produce a finer
resolution for smaller amplitudes, meaning that subtle signal components will be less affected than
louder ones. The total amount of distortion produced with different Shape settings will depend upon
the dynamic range of the input signal.

Enabling the DC Shift button applies an amplitude offset before the quantization process. This
significantly changes the sound of the quantization distortion, especially when Bits is set to lower
values, increasing volume and adding crunch!

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100%
when using Redux in a return track.

26.31 Resonators

The Resonators Effect.

This device consists of five parallel resonators that superimpose a tonal character on the input source.
It can produce sounds resembling anything from plucked strings to vocoder-like effects. The resonators
are tuned in semitones, providing a musical way of adjusting them. The first resonator defines the root
pitch and the four others are tuned relative to this pitch in musical intervals.

The input signal passes first through a filter, and then into the resonators. There are four input filter
types to select from: low-pass, band-pass, high-pass and notch. The input filter frequency can be
adjusted with the Frequency parameter.

The first resonator is fed with both the left and right input channels, while the second and fourth
resonators are dedicated to the left channel, and the third and fifth to the right channel.

The Note parameter defines the root pitch of all the resonators ranging from C-1 to C5. It can also be
detuned in cents using the Fine parameter. The Decay parameter lets you adjust the amount of time it
takes for the resonators to be silent after getting an input signal. The longer the decay time, the more
tonal the result will be, similar to the behavior of an undamped piano string. As with a real string, the
decay time depends on the pitch, so low notes will last longer than higher ones. The Const switch
holds the decay time constant regardless of the actual pitch.

Resonators provides two different resonation modes. Mode A provides a more realistic sounding
resonation, while Mode B offers an effect that is especially interesting when Resonator I’s Note
parameter is set to lower pitches.

The brightness of the resulting sound can be adjusted using the Color control.

All of the resonators have an On/Off switch and a Gain control. A resonator that is turned off does
not need CPU. Turning off the first resonator does not affect the other ones.

Resonators II through V follow the Note parameter defined in Resonator I, but they can each be
individually transposed +/- 24 semitones using the Pitch controls and detuned in cents using the
Detune controls.

The output section features the obligatory Dry/Wet control and a Width parameter that affects only
the wet signal and blends the left and right outputs of Resonators II-V into a mono signal if set to zero.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.
