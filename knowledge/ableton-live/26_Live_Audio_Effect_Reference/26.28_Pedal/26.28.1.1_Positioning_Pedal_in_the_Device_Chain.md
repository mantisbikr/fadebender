# 26.28.1.1 Positioning Pedal in the Device Chain

The incoming signal will have an impact on how the distortion will respond. For example, adding a
Compressor before Pedal in the device chain will give a more balanced end result. On the other
hand, adding an EQ or filter with high gain and resonance settings before Pedal can yield a
screaming distortion effect.

26.28.1.2 Techno Kick

Choose a suitable kick with a long decay (e.g., Kit-Core 909, with decay turned up). Then, choose the
Distort pedal, activate the Sub switch, and dial in the Gain to your taste.

For added “whack”, move the Mid Frequency switch to the right-most position and increase the Mid
control. For more “thump”, you can increase the Bass control.

To reduce the “air”, decrease the Treble control.
