# 26.28 Pedal

The Pedal Effect.

Pedal is a guitar distortion effect. In combination with Live’s Tuner, Amp and Cabinet effects, Pedal is
great for processing guitar sounds. Pedal can also be used in less conventional settings, such as a
standalone effect on vocals, synths or drums.

The Gain control adjusts the amount of distortion applied to the dry signal. Note that 0% does not
mean zero distortion. It is recommended to dial the Gain back to 0% and slowly increase it until you
get the desired output level. When placed in front of Pedal in a device chain, Utility’s Gain parameter
can be used to lower the signal even further.

The global Output knob adjusts the overall output gain of the device.

You can choose between three different Pedal Types, each inspired by distortion pedals with their own
distinct sonic characteristics:

•

Overdrive: warm and smooth

•
•

Distortion: tight and aggressive
Fuzz: unstable, with a “broken amp” sound

Pedal has a three-band EQ that adjusts the timbre of the sound after the distortion is applied. The EQ
is adaptive, which means that the amount of resonance (or “Q”) increases as the amount of EQ boost
increases.

The Bass control is a peak EQ, with a center frequency of 100 Hz. This is useful for boosting the
“punch” in bass or drum sounds, or attenuating low frequencies of guitars.

The Mid control is a three-way switchable boosting EQ. The Mid Frequency switch sets the center
frequency and range of the Mid control. The center frequency is the middle of the frequency range
that the Mid control operates upon. The frequency range around this center value is narrower in the
lowest switch setting and wider in the higher setting. This is common in guitar pedals where it is normal
to make tight cuts and boosts at low frequencies, and wider cuts and boosts at high frequencies.

The center frequencies for the switch settings are:

•
•
•

Lowest setting, positioned on the left side: 500 Hz
Middle setting, positioned in the center: 1 kHz
Highest setting, positioned on the right side: 2 kHz

The Treble control is a shelving EQ, with a cutoff frequency of 3.3 kHz. This is useful for removing
harsh high frequencies (or boosting them, if that’s your cup of tea!).

Tip: For a more fine-grained EQ post-distortion, simply leave these controls in their neutral position
and instead use another EQ, such as EQ Eight.

The Sub switch toggles a low shelf filter that boosts frequencies below 250 Hz. You can use this in
conjunction with the Bass control by turning Sub on and setting the Bass to -100%, or turning Sub off
and setting the Bass to 100%.

The Dry/Wet slider adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.

Aliasing can be reduced by enabling Hi-Quality mode, which can be accessed via the device title
bar’s context menu. This improves the sound quality, particularly with high frequency signals, but there
is a slight increase in CPU usage.

26.28.1 Pedal Tips

26.28.1.1 Positioning Pedal in the Device Chain

The incoming signal will have an impact on how the distortion will respond. For example, adding a
Compressor before Pedal in the device chain will give a more balanced end result. On the other
hand, adding an EQ or filter with high gain and resonance settings before Pedal can yield a
screaming distortion effect.

26.28.1.2 Techno Kick

Choose a suitable kick with a long decay (e.g., Kit-Core 909, with decay turned up). Then, choose the
Distort pedal, activate the Sub switch, and dial in the Gain to your taste.

For added “whack”, move the Mid Frequency switch to the right-most position and increase the Mid
control. For more “thump”, you can increase the Bass control.

To reduce the “air”, decrease the Treble control.

26.28.1.3 Drum Group Fizzle

To add “fizzle” to a drum group, choose the Fuzz pedal, increase the Gain to 50% and make sure the
Sub switch is disabled.

Reduce the Bass and Mid controls to -100%, and adjust the Mid Frequency Switch to taste. Increase
the Treble to 100%.

Set the Output to -20dB. Then, turn the Dry/Wet slider down to 0% and slowly increase it until the
drums are fizzling to your taste.

26.28.1.4 Broken Speaker

Select the Fuzz pedal, and make sure the Sub switch is disabled. Turn down the Bass control
completely, and set the Treble to 25%.

Set the Mid control 100% and move the Mid Frequency switch to right-most position. Finally, set the
Gain control to 100%.

26.28.1.5 Sub Warmer

To add upper harmonics and warmth to a simple sub bass, choose the OD pedal, turn on the Sub
switch and turn up the Bass control. Then, slowly increase the Gain until the desired effect is reached.
You can then cut or boost the mid frequencies using the Mid control.

26.29 Phaser-Flanger

The Phaser-Flanger Effect.

Phaser-Flanger combines the functionalities of flanger and phaser effects into one device with
separate modes, and offers an additional Doubler mode. All modes can be used to create lush,
expressive sounds with a wide variety of tools and detailed options. Two LFOs and an envelope
follower provide plenty of modulation possibilities.

You can choose between the three modes in the display:

•

•

•

Phaser, with its wide range of frequency and modulation ranges, creates wandering notch
filters by feeding a phase-shifted version of the input signal back into the input. The phase
shifting is achieved using modulated all-pass filters and has a lush sound.
Flanger creates a continuously changing comb filter effect by adding a time-modulated
delayed signal with feedback to the input.
Doubler creates the effect of doubled tracks (multiple stacked versions of similar recording
takes) by adding time-modulated delayed signals to the input.

The display contains a visualization and the mode selector buttons. The visualization presents different
information depending on the mode you choose and the LFO Stereo Mode’s settings (described in
more detail below).

In Phaser mode, the visualization shows the number of notches and their spectral positions.

Phaser’s parameters can be adjusted in the lower portion of the display.

Notches increases or decreases the number of all-pass filters being used. Center chooses the center
frequency of the notches. Spread increases or decreases the distance between the notches by
adjusting the Q factor of the all-pass filters. Blend mixes the modulation routing between Center
Frequency and Spread, with Center Frequency at 0.0 and Spread at 1.0.

In Flanger mode, the visualization shows how the modulation signal is affecting the delay time, with
the left-most position equaling the value chosen in the Time parameter. As the visualization moves to
the right, the delay time decreases; as it moves to the left, it increases. Time adjusts the delay time of
the Flanger delay lines.

In Doubler mode, the visualization acts differently than in Flanger mode. Modulation in Doubler mode
is bipolar, meaning that, as the visualization moves to the right, the delay time increases; as it moves to
the left, it decreases. Time adjusts the delay time of the Doubler delay lines.

For finer control over the sound, you can unfold the device by toggling the
Flanger’s title bar to reveal further options for the main LFO, as well as a second LFO, an envelope
follower and a Safe Bass high-pass filter. Also shown is a visualization for the main LFO, in which its
rate, waveform and the phase relationships of the stereo channels are shown.

The Phaser-Flanger Effect’s Unfolded View.

The main LFO’s speed is controlled by the Freq/Rate parameter, and can be either tempo-synced or
free-running. Use the Modulation Sync buttons to the left of the dial to switch between Frequency and
Sync Rate. When set to Hz, the corresponding Freq dial controls the LFO rate in Hertz; otherwise, the
Rate dial will sync the LFO with the song tempo.

Multiple waveforms for the main LFO are available and can be found in the LFO Waveform chooser.
These include Sine, Triangle (default), Saw Up, Saw Down, Rectangle, Random, and Random S&H
(Sample and Hold). Also included are Triangle Analog, Triangle 8, Triangle 16, which are described
below:

•

•
•

Triangle Analog is a low-pass filtered rectangular waveform which changes shape and
amplitude drastically for different LFO rates.
Triangle 8 divides a period of a normal triangular wave into eight discrete steps.
Triangle 16 divides a period of a normal triangular wave into 16 discrete steps.

The LFO Stereo Mode button switches between Phase and Spin modes, both of which allow
modulation of each stereo channel independently.

When Phase is chosen, adjusting the Phase value will change the phase relationship between the left
and right channels. At 180°, the phase of the left and right channels are completely inverted. This can
be seen in the LFOs visualization.

When Spin is chosen, adjusting the Spin value detunes the two LFO rates relative to each other. This
can be seen in the main display’s visualization.

Duty Cycle will change the time scale of the waveform’s period, compressing it towards either the front
of the cycle (100%) or the back of the cycle (-100%). At 0%, the time scale of the period is spread
equally across the entire cycle, leaving the waveform unaffected. This is similar to how Pulse Width
affects rectangular waveforms, and its effects can be seen in the waveform view of the main LFO. This
parameter doesn’t affect the noise-based Random and Random S&H modulation waveforms.

The second LFO always has a triangular waveform, and can be controlled using the LFO2 Mix and
LFO2 Freq/Rate parameters.

LFO2 Mix sets the amount of the LFO2 that is mixed with the main LFO. At 0%, only the main LFO is
active; at 100% only LFO2 is active.

The second LFO’s speed can be set as either free-running or tempo-synced by using the Modulation
Sync 2 toggle buttons. When free-running, the sync frequencies are shown in Hertz and can be
adjusted using the LFO2 Freq parameter. When tempo-synced, beat divisions are shown instead and
can be set using the LFO2 Rate parameter.

Global parameters available include Amount, Feedback, Output, Warmth and Dry/Wet. The
additional envelope follower and Safe Bass high-pass filter are accessible when the device is
unfolded.

Amount adjusts the amount of delay modulation that is applied to incoming signals and affects both
the main LFO and LFO2.

Feedback sets the amount of each channel’s output that is fed back to its input. Increasing this sounds
more extreme and tends to create a strong comb filtering effect, amplifying some frequencies and
attenuating others. In Doubler Mode, it will also create audible delays if playback is stopped. The
feedback signal can be inverted using the Ø button, which results in a “hollow” sound when
combined with high feedback values.

Caution: high feedback values in combination with certain settings can cause quick increases in
volume levels. Be sure to protect your ears and equipment!

Below the main LFO you will find an envelope follower. An envelope follower uses the amplitude from
an incoming audio signal and translates it to a modulation source.

To use the envelope follower, activate the Env Fol button and set the Envelope Amount value to a
value other than zero. Envelope Amount adjusts the intensity of the modulation caused by the
envelope follower. Negative values invert the phase of the envelope.

Attack and Release adjust the attack and release portions of the envelope follower’s envelope.
Shorter Attack times cause the envelope follower to act more quickly, while longer times delay its
onset. Shorter Release times cause the envelope follower to stop its effect faster than longer Release
times.

Safe Bass is a high-pass filter, effectively reducing the effect on signal components below the
specified frequency. The applicable range is from 5 Hz to 3000 Hz. This can make mixing certain
bass-heavy material easier.

Output sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal. The Warmth control adds slight
distortion and filtering for a warmer sound. The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the
processed and dry signals. Set it to 100% when using Phaser-Flanger in a return track.
