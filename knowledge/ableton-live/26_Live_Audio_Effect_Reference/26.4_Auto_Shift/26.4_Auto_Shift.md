# 26.4 Auto Shift

The Auto Shift Effect.

Auto Shift is a real-time pitch tracking and correction device with controls for vibrato, pitch shifting,
and formant shifting. Its design makes it especially well-suited for transforming vocals, though it can
be used with any monophonic audio signal. You can pitch correct audio using a defined scale or
using the MIDI notes from a separate track. Auto Shift also includes a built-in LFO, so you can
modulate incoming audio over time.

26.4.1 Input Section

Auto Shift’s Input Section.

Auto Shift can receive audio as well as MIDI input. The Input section lets you configure how incoming
signals are processed in the device.

The Input Pitch display shows the pitch of the incoming audio in notes and cents.

You can set the frequency range for the audio input using one of the three Pitch Range toggles. This
helps optimize the quality of the pitch estimation and correction. Use High for signals in a high
frequency range, Mid for signals in a mid frequency range, and Bass for signals in a low frequency
range. Each toggle has an LED that flashes when the incoming audio falls within its corresponding
range.

The Pitch Range LED Flashes to Indicate the Range for the Incoming Signal.

Note that each pitch range setting affects the device’s latency differently, so switching between
toggles changes the overall latency.

You can use the Input Gain slider to adjust the gain of the incoming signal from -24 to +24 dB.

The Latency Readout displays the device’s latency in milliseconds. Enabling Live Mode via the toggle
in the device’s title bar can help reduce latency, which is particularly useful for live performances.
However, slight glitches may occur during note onsets or rapid pitch changes in this mode.

Enable Live Mode to Reduce Latency.

26.4.1.1 MIDI Input

Auto Shift’s MIDI Input Panel.

Enabling MIDI input lets you use the notes from a separate MIDI track to pitch correct the incoming
audio instead of tuning it to a defined scale via the Quantizer.

The MIDI In toggle shows or hides the MIDI Input panel, which contains track routing and voice mode
settings.

Use the MIDI On toggle to activate or deactivate MIDI input. When enabled, the Quantizer tab is
replaced with the MIDI tab, where you can further shape the behavior of incoming MIDI notes.

The External Source chooser sets the MIDI sidechain source, i.e., the track used to send notes to Auto
Shift. The Tapping Point chooser lets you specify whether the MIDI sidechain is sent before or after any
MIDI effects that are in the source track’s device chain. Select Pre FX to bypass the effects on the track,
or select Post FX or Post Mixer to include them.

There are two voice mode toggles to choose from: Mono and Poly. Mono uses a single voice,
meaning that only one note can be used for the pitch correction at a time. You can use the Glide slider
to set the time that overlapping notes take to slide their pitch to the next incoming pitch. Poly can use
up to eight voices at once, making it ideal for harmonization. Use the Voice Count chooser to set the
maximum number of voices to 2, 4, or 8.

Note that when using MIDI input, Auto Shift will only produce sound when MIDI notes are received.

26.4.2 Quantizer Tab

Auto Shift’s Quantizer Tab.

The Quantizer corrects incoming audio according to the notes of a defined scale. In the Quantizer
tab, you can access controls for monitoring how the signal is processed, as well as controls for
adjusting the correction.

The Pitch Correction Meter displays how much the incoming signal is being shifted in cents to match
the target note, which is shown beneath the meter. The target note is determined by the set scale.

You can adjust the intensity of the pitch correction using the Correction Strength slider. The higher the
value, the more the audio is shifted to match the target note. Use the Smooth toggle to switch
smoothing on or off. When enabled, pitch transitions between notes are smoothed, and more natural
vibrato is retained. You can set the smoothing time from 0 to 200 milliseconds using the Smoothing
Time slider. The Correction Strength and Smoothing parameters determine the overall style of the pitch
correction. With these settings, you can produce results ranging from subtle and nuanced to rigid and
quantized.

The Included Notes in Scale display determines which notes are used for the pitch correction. You can
create a custom scale by selecting notes in the display, or you can set the key and scale using the
Root and Scale choosers. The Pitch Shift slider can be used to transpose the pitch up or down in scale
degrees; the pitch shift is applied after the correction.

Auto Shift supports scale awareness: when the Use Current Scale toggle in the device title bar is
enabled, the Quantizer follows the clip’s current scale. Additionally, the Included Keys in Scale
display highlights the selected scale’s notes in purple, and the Root and Scale choosers are
deactivated.

26.4.3 MIDI Tab

Auto Shift’s MIDI Tab.

When MIDI input is activated, the Quantizer tab is replaced with the MIDI tab, where you can
customize the behavior of incoming MIDI.

The piano visualization displays notes as they are received from the source track. These notes are then
used to correct the incoming audio.

Using MIDI Notes to Pitch Correct Audio.

Note that scale awareness is not available when using MIDI input. To use the notes within a specific
scale, you can add the Scale MIDI effect to the source track. Make sure Auto Shift’s Tapping Point
chooser is set to Post FX or Post Mixer so that the effect is included.

The Attack Time slider sets the attack time of the note’s envelope from 0 to 1,000 milliseconds. The
Release Time slider sets the release time of the note’s envelope from 0 to 5 seconds.

When the Note Latch toggle is switched on, MIDI notes are held until the next Note On message. The
Pitch Bend Range control sets the device’s pitch bend range, from 0 to 48 semitones.

In the Mod Routing section, four parameters can be modulated using MIDI or MPE data: Pitch,
Formant, Volume, and Pan. Each parameter can be modulated by one of six modulation sources:
Velocity, Pressure, Mod Wheel, Pitch Bend, Note PB, or Slide. Use each target’s dedicated Mod
Source drop-down menu to select a modulation source, and adjust the modulation depth with its
corresponding Mod Depth slider.

26.4.4 LFO Tab

Auto Shift’s LFO Tab.

You can use the built-in LFO to apply modulation to the incoming audio’s pitch, formants, volume, and
panning.

The LFO Reset toggle switches LFO re-triggering on or off. When enabled, the LFO’s phase will be re-
triggered at note onsets. When using the Quantizer, an onset occurs when a pitch is detected after a
period of unpitched audio. The Onset Indicator LED flashes when the LFO’s phase is re-triggered.
With MIDI input, an onset occurs at the start of a new note, and the Onset Indicator becomes the
Trigger Indicator.

The LFO Delay slider sets the delay time before the attack phase begins, from 0 to 1.5 seconds. The
LFO Attack slider sets the attack time during which the LFO’s level increases to its peak level, from 0 to
2 seconds. As you modify either value, the waveform in the display will reflect the changes.

You can select from nine modulation waveforms using the LFO Waveform drop-down menu: Sine,
Triangle, Triangle 8, Triangle 16, Saw Up, Saw Down, Rectangle, Random, and Random S&H.

The LFO Rate slider lets you select the speed of the LFO in milliseconds or tempo-synced beat
divisions, as determined by the LFO Sync toggles.

In the Mod Routing section, you can modulate four parameters using the LFO: Pitch, Formant, Volume,
and Pan. The individual Mod Depth sliders set the amount of modulation that is applied to each
parameter.

Note that the LFO modulation affects the incoming signal regardless of whether it is being pitch-
corrected.

26.4.5 Pitch Section

Auto Shift’s Pitch Section.

You can apply both pitch and formant shifting to incoming signals using the controls in the Pitch
section.

The Pitch Shift control sets the amount of transposition applied in semitones. You can use the Pitch Shift
Fine slider to set the transposition in cents.

Use the Formant Shift control to shift the formants — the resonant frequencies that help define the tonal
characteristics of a sound — within a range of -100% to 100%. At higher values, pitches will sound
higher and more resonant, while at lower values pitches will sound lower and less full. Shifting
formants lets you create a higher or lower sound without actually transposing the pitch.

The Formant Follow slider determines how much of the formant shifting follows the pitch shifting; higher
values result in a more natural-sounding transposition.

Note that you can use the Pitch Shift and Formant Shift controls with or without pitch correcting the
signal.

26.4.6 Vibrato Section

Auto Shift’s Vibrato Section.

The Vibrato section contains controls for applying vibrato to incoming audio and adjusting the overall
balance of the dry and processed signal.

There are three main vibrato controls:

•
•
•

Vibrato Amount — adjusts the depth of the vibrato, from 0 to 200 cents.
Vibrato Rate — adjusts the speed of the vibrato, from 2 to 15 Hz.
Vibrato Fade In — adjusts the vibrato’s fade-in time in milliseconds.

Enabling the Natural Vibrato toggle creates variations in the vibrato’s speed and depth, producing a
more realistic effect.

Note that you can use the vibrato controls with or without pitch correcting the signal.

The Dry/Wet slider sets the balance between the dry and processed signals. At 0%, no pitch
correction is applied, while at 100%, only the pitch corrected signal is heard. You can create a
doubler effect by setting this value to 50%, which equally balances the original and corrected signals.

26.5 Beat Repeat

The Beat Repeat Effect.

Beat Repeat allows for the creation of controlled or randomized repetitions of an incoming signal.

The Interval control defines how often Beat Repeat captures new material and begins repeating it.
Interval is synced to and set in terms of the song tempo, with values ranging from ”1/32” to ”4 Bars.”
The Offset control shifts the point defined by Interval forward in time. If Interval is set to ”1 Bar,” for
example, and Offset to ”8/16”, material will be captured for repetition once per bar on the third beat
(i.e., halfway, or eight-sixteenths of the way, through the bar).

You can add randomness to the process using the Chance control, which defines the likelihood of
repetitions actually taking place when Interval and Offset ”ask” for them. If Chance is set to 100
percent, repetitions will always take place at the given Interval/Offset time; if set to zero, there will be
no repetitions.

Gate defines the total length of all repetitions in sixteenth notes. If Gate is set to ”4/16”, the
repetitions will occur over the period of one beat, starting at the position defined by Interval and
Offset.

Activating the Repeat button bypasses all of the above controls, immediately capturing material and
repeating it until deactivated.

The Grid control defines the grid size — the size of each repeated slice. If set to ”1/16”, a slice the
size of one sixteenth note will be captured and repeated for the given Gate length (or until Repeat is
deactivated). Large grid values create rhythmic loops, while small values create sonic artifacts. The
No Triplets button sets grid division as binary.

Grid size can be changed randomly using the Variation control. If Variation is set to ”0”, grid size is
fixed. But when Variation is set to higher values, the grid fluctuates considerably around the set Grid
value. Variation has several different modes, available in the chooser below: Trigger creates
variations of the grid when repetitions are triggered; 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16 trigger variations in regular
intervals; and Auto forces Beat Repeat to apply a new random variation after each repetition — the
most complex form of grid variation in Beat Repeat (especially if triplets are also allowed).

Beat Repeat’s repetitions can be pitched down for special sonic effects. Pitch is adjusted through
resampling in Beat Repeat, lengthening segments to pitch them down without again compressing them
to adjust for the length change. This means that the rhythmical structure can become quite ambiguous
with higher Pitch values. The Pitch Decay control tapers the pitch curve, making each repeated slice
play lower than the previous one. Warning: This is the most obscure parameter of Beat Repeat.

Beat Repeat includes a combined low-pass and high-pass filter for defining the passed frequency
range of the device. You can turn the filter on and off, and set the center frequency and width of the
passed frequency band, using the respective controls.

The original signal (which was received at Beat Repeat’s input) is mixed with Beat Repeat’s repetitions
according to one of three mix modes: Mix allows the original signal to pass through the device and
have repetitions added to it; Insert mutes the original signal when repetitions are playing but passes it
otherwise; and Gate passes only the repetitions, never passing the original signal. Gate mode is
especially useful when the effect is housed in a return track.

You can set the output level of the device using the Volume control, and apply Decay to create
gradually fading repetitions.

26.6 Cabinet

The Cabinet Effect.

Cabinet is an effect that emulates the sound of five classic guitar cabinets. Developed in collaboration
with Softube, Cabinet uses physical modelling technology to provide a range of authentic sounds,
with optimized mics and mic positioning.

The Speaker chooser allows you to select from a variety of speaker sizes and combinations. The
chooser’s entries indicate the number of speakers and the speaker size in inches. For example, ”4x12”
means four 12-inch speakers. In the real world, more and larger speakers generally means higher
volumes.

The Microphone chooser changes the position of the virtual microphone in relation to the speaker
cabinet. Near On-Axis micing results in a bright, focused sound, while Near Off-Axis is more resonant
and a bit less bright. Choose the Far position for a balanced sound that also has some characteristics
of the virtual ”room.”

Cabinet Mic Positions.

The switch below the Microphone chooser toggles between a Dynamic and Condenser mic. Dynamic
mics are a bit grittier and commonly used when close-micing guitar cabinets because they are
capable of handling much higher volumes. Condenser mics are more accurate, and are commonly
used for micing from a distance. Of course, Cabinet’s virtual condenser mic won’t be damaged by
high volume levels, so feel free to experiment.

The Output switch toggles between mono and stereo (Dual) processing. Note that in Dual mode,
Cabinet uses twice as much CPU.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.

26.6.1 Cabinet Tips

Here are some tips for using Cabinet:

26.6.1.1 Amps and Cabinets

Guitar cabinets are normally fed by guitar amps. For this reason, Cabinet is paired with Amp, and the
two are normally used together. But you can also achieve interesting and exotic sounds by using Amp
and Cabinet separately.

26.6.1.2 Multiple mics

A common studio technique is to use multiple mics on a single cabinet, and then adjust the balance
during mixing. This is easy to do by using Live’s Audio Effect Racks. Try this:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Configure one instance of Cabinet as you like.
Put the Cabinet into an Audio Effect Rack.
Duplicate the Rack chain that contains the original Cabinet as many times as you like.
In the additional chains, choose a different Microphone setting and/or mic type.
Adjust the relative volumes of the Rack’s chains in the Rack’s mixer.
