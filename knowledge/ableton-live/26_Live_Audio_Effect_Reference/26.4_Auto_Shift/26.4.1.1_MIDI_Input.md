# 26.4.1.1 MIDI Input

Auto Shift’s MIDI Input Panel.

Enabling MIDI input lets you use the notes from a separate MIDI track to pitch correct the incoming
audio instead of tuning it to a defined scale via the Quantizer.

The MIDI In toggle shows or hides the MIDI Input panel, which contains track routing and voice mode
settings.

Use the MIDI On toggle to activate or deactivate MIDI input. When enabled, the Quantizer tab is
replaced with the MIDI tab, where you can further shape the behavior of incoming MIDI notes.

The External Source chooser sets the MIDI sidechain source, i.e., the track used to send notes to Auto
Shift. The Tapping Point chooser lets you specify whether the MIDI sidechain is sent before or after any
MIDI effects that are in the source track’s device chain. Select Pre FX to bypass the effects on the track,
or select Post FX or Post Mixer to include them.

There are two voice mode toggles to choose from: Mono and Poly. Mono uses a single voice,
meaning that only one note can be used for the pitch correction at a time. You can use the Glide slider
to set the time that overlapping notes take to slide their pitch to the next incoming pitch. Poly can use
up to eight voices at once, making it ideal for harmonization. Use the Voice Count chooser to set the
maximum number of voices to 2, 4, or 8.

Note that when using MIDI input, Auto Shift will only produce sound when MIDI notes are received.
