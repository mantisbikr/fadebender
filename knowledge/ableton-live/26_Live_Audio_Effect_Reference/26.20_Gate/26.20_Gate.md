# 26.20 Gate

The Gate Effect.

The Gate effect passes only signals whose level exceeds a user-specified threshold. A gate can
eliminate low-level noise that occurs between sounds (e.g., hiss or hum), or shape a sound by turning
up the threshold so that it cuts off reverb or delay tails or truncates an instrument’s natural decay.

Gate’s display area shows the level of the input signal in light gray and the level of the output signal in
a darker gray with a white outline. This allows you to see the amount of gating that is occurring at any
moment, and helps you to set the appropriate parameters.

The Threshold knob sets the gate’s sensitivity. The Threshold value is represented in the display as a
horizontal blue line, which can also be dragged.

Return (also known as “hysteresis”) sets the difference between the level that opens the gate and the
level that closes it. Higher hysteresis values reduce “chatter” caused by the gate rapidly opening and
closing when the input signal is near the threshold level. The Return value is represented in the display
as an additional horizontal orange line.

With the Flip button enabled, the gate works in reverse; the signal will only pass if its level is below the
threshold.

A gate can only react to an input signal once it occurs. Since it also needs to apply an attack/release
envelope, the gating is always a bit too late. A digital gate can solve this problem by simply delaying
the input signal a little bit. Gate offers three different Lookahead times: zero ms, one ms and ten ms.
The results may sound pretty different depending on this setting.

The Attack time determines how long it takes for the gate to switch from closed to open when a signal
goes from below to above the threshold. Very short attack times can produce sharp clicking sounds,
while long times soften the sound’s attack.

When the signal goes from above to below the threshold, the Hold time kicks in. After the hold time
expires, the gate closes over a period of time set by the Release parameter.

The Floor knob sets the amount of attenuation that will be applied when the gate is closed. If set to -inf
dB, a closed gate will mute the input signal. A setting of 0.00 dB means that even if the gate is closed,
there is no effect on the signal. Settings in between these two extremes attenuate the input to a greater
or lesser degree when the gate is closed.

Normally, the signal being gated and the input source that triggers the gate are the same signal. But
by using sidechaining, it is possible to gate a signal based on the level of another signal. To access
the Sidechain parameters, unfold the Gate window by toggling the

 button in its title bar.

Gate’s Sidechain Parameters.

Enabling this section with the Sidechain button allows you to select another track from the choosers
below. This causes the selected track’s signal to act as the gate’s trigger, instead of the signal that is
actually being gated.

The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you
to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the gate’s trigger. With Dry/Wet at 100%,
the gate is triggered entirely by the sidechain source. At 0%, the sidechain is effectively bypassed.
Note that increasing the gain does not increase the volume of the source signal in the mix. The
sidechain audio is only a trigger for the gate and is never actually heard.

Sidechain gating can be used to superimpose rhythmic patterns from one source onto another. For
example, a held pad sound can be triggered with the rhythm of a drum loop by inserting a Gate on
the pad’s track and choosing the drum loop’s track as the sidechain input.

On the right of the external section are the controls for the sidechain EQ. Enabling this section causes
the gate to be triggered by a specific band of frequencies, instead of a complete signal. These can
either be frequencies in the signal to be gated or, by using the EQ in conjunction with an external
sidechain, frequencies in another track’s audio.

The headphones button between the external and EQ sections allows you to listen to only the
sidechain input, bypassing the gate’s output. Since the sidechain audio isn’t fed to the output, and is
only a trigger for the gate, this temporary listening option can make it much easier to set sidechain
parameters and hear what’s actually making the gate work. When this button is on, the display area
shows the level of the sidechain input signal in green.

26.21 Glue Compressor

The Glue Compressor Effect.

The Glue Compressor is an analog-modeled compressor created in collaboration with Cytomic, and
is based on the classic bus compressor from a famous 80’s mixing console. Like Live’s original
Compressor, the Glue Compressor can be used for basic dynamics control of individual tracks, but is
mainly designed for use on the Main track or a Group Track to “glue” multiple sources together into a
cohesive sounding mix.

The Threshold knob sets where compression begins. Signals above the threshold are attenuated by an
amount specified by the Ratio parameter, which sets the ratio between the input and output signal.
Unlike the Compressor, the Glue Compressor does not have a user-adjustable knee. Instead, the knee
becomes more sharp as the ratio increases.

Attack defines how long it takes to reach maximum compression once a signal exceeds the threshold.
The Attack knob’s values are in milliseconds. Release sets how long it takes for the compressor to
return to normal operation after the signal falls below the threshold. The Release knob’s values are in
seconds. When Release is set to A (Auto), the release time will adjust automatically based on the
incoming audio. The Glue Compressor’s Auto Release actually uses two times - a slow one as a base
compression value, and a fast one to react to transients in the signal. Auto Release may be too slow to
react to sudden changes in level, but generally is a useful way to tame a wide range of material in a
gentle way.

Dry/Wet adjusts the balance between the compressed and uncompressed signals. At 100%, only the
compressed signal is heard, while at 0%, the device is effectively bypassed. Another way of
controlling the amount of compression is with the Range slider, which sets how much compression can

occur. Values between about -60 and -70 dB emulate the original hardware, while values between
-40 and -15 dB can be useful as an alternative to the Dry/Wet control. At 0 dB, no compression
occurs.

Makeup applies gain to the signal, allowing you to compensate for the reduction in level caused by
compression. A Makeup value that roughly corresponds to the position of the needle in the display
should result in a level close to what you had before compressing.

The Soft clip switch toggles a fixed waveshaper, useful for taming very loud transients. When enabled,
the Glue Compressor’s maximum output level is -.5 dB. Note that with Oversampling enabled, very
loud peaks may still exceed 0 dB. The Soft clipper is not a transparent limiter, and will distort your
signal when active. We recommend leaving it disabled unless this particular type of “colored”
distortion is what you’re looking for.

The Glue Compressor’s needle display shows the amount of gain reduction in dB. The Clip LED turns
red if the device’s output level is exceeding 0 dB. If Soft clipping is enabled, this LED turns yellow to
indicate that peaks are being clipped.

26.21.1 Sidechain Parameters

The Glue Compressor With Sidechain Section.

Normally, the signal being compressed and the input source that triggers the compressor are the same
signal. But by using sidechaining, it is possible to compress a signal based on the level of another
signal or a specific frequency component. To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold the Glue
Compressor window by toggling the

 button in its title bar.

The sidechain parameters are divided into two sections. On the left are the external controls. Enabling
this section with the Sidechain button allows you to select any of Live’s internal routing points from the
choosers below. This causes the selected source to act as the Glue Compressor’s trigger, instead of the
signal that is actually being compressed.

The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you
to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the Glue Compressor’s trigger. With Dry/
Wet at 100%, the Glue Compressor is triggered entirely by the sidechain source. At 0%, the sidechain

is effectively bypassed. Note that increasing the gain does not increase the volume of the source
signal in the mix. The sidechain audio is only a trigger for the Glue Compressor and is never actually
heard.

On the right of the external section are the controls for the sidechain EQ. Enabling this section causes
the Glue Compressor to be triggered by a specific band of frequencies, instead of a complete signal.
These can either be frequencies in the compressed signal or, by using the EQ in conjunction with an
external sidechain, frequencies in another track’s audio.

The headphones button between the external and EQ sections allows you to listen to only the
sidechain input, bypassing the Glue Compressor’s output. Since the sidechain audio isn’t fed to the
output, and is only a trigger for the Glue Compressor, this temporary listening option can make it
much easier to set sidechain parameters and hear what’s actually making the Glue Compressor work.

26.21.1.1 Context Menu Options for Glue Compressor

Oversampling can be toggled on or off via the device title bar’s context menu. Enabling this option
causes the Glue Compressor to internally process at two times the current sampling rate, which may
reduce aliasing and transient harshness. There is a slight increase in CPU usage with Oversampling
enabled. Note that with Oversampling enabled, the level may exceed 0 dB even with Soft clip
enabled.
