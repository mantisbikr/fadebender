# 26.19 Filter Delay

The Filter Delay Effect.

The Filter Delay provides three independent delay lines, each preceded by linked low-pass and high-
pass filters. This allows applying delay to only certain input signal frequencies, as determined by the
filter settings. The feedback from each of the three delays is also routed back through the filters.

Each of the three delays can be switched on and off independently. The Filter Delay device assigns
delay 1 to the input signal’s left channel, delay 2 to the left and right channels and delay 3 to the right
channel. The Pan controls at the right can override the delay channels’ outputs; otherwise each delay
outputs on the channel from which it derives its input.

Each delay channel’s filter has an associated On switch, located to the left of each X-Y controller. The
X-Y controllers adjust the low-pass and high-pass filters simultaneously for each delay. To edit filter
bandwidth, click and drag on the vertical axis; click and drag on the horizontal axis to set the filter
band’s frequency.

To refer delay time to the song tempo, activate the Sync switch, which allows using the Delay Time
beat division chooser. The numbered switches represent time delay in 16th notes. For example,
selecting ”4” delays the signal by four 16th notes, which equals one beat (a quarter note) of delay.
With Sync Mode active, changing the Delay Time field percentage value shortens and extends delay
times by fractional amounts, thus producing the ”swing” type of timing effect found in drum machines.

If the Sync switch is off, the delay time reverts to milliseconds. In this case, to edit the delay time, click
and drag up or down in the Delay Time field, or click in the field and type in a value.

The Feedback parameter sets how much of the output signal returns to the delay line input. Very high
values can lead to runaway feedback and produce a loud oscillation — watch your ears and
speakers if you decide to check out extreme feedback settings!

Each delay channel has its own volume control, which can be turned up to +6 dB to compensate for
drastic filtering at the input.

The Dry control adjusts the unprocessed signal level. Set it to minimum if using Delay in a return track.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
