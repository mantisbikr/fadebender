# 26.42 Vocoder

The Vocoder Effect.

(Note: The Vocoder effect is not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.)

A vocoder is an effect that combines the frequency information of one audio signal (called the carrier)
with the amplitude contour of another audio signal (called the modulator). The modulator source is
generally something with a clear rhythmic character such as speech or drums, while the carrier is
typically a harmonically-rich synthesizer sound such as a string or pad. The most familiar application
of a vocoder is to create ”talking synthesizer” or robotic voice effects.

Vocoders work by running both the carrier and modulator signals through banks of band-pass filters.
The output level of each of the modulator’s filters is then analyzed and used to control the volume of
the corresponding filter for the carrier signal.

Live’s Vocoder should be inserted on the track that contains the audio material you plan to use as your
modulator. The Carrier chooser then provides a variety of options for the carrier signal:

•

•

•

Noise uses Vocoder’s internal noise generator as the carrier source. With this selected, an X-Y
display is shown which allows you to adjust the character of the noise. The horizontal axis
adjusts downsampling. Click and drag to the left to decrease the sample rate of the carrier’s
output. The vertical axis adjusts the density of the noise. Click and drag downward to decrease
the density.
External allows you to select any available internal routing points from the choosers below. This
is the option you’ll want for classic ”robot voice” applications.
Modulator uses the modulator itself as the carrier. This essentially outputs a resynthesized
version of the modulator signal, but allows you to use Vocoder’s sound-shaping controls to
adjust the sound.

•

Pitch Tracking enables a monophonic oscillator, which tunes itself to the pitch of the modulator.
The High and Low sliders allow you to limit the frequency range that the oscillator will attempt
to track. Choose from sawtooth or one of three pulse waveforms and adjust the coarse tuning of
the oscillator via the Pitch slider. Pitch tracking is particularly effective with monophonic
modulator sources such as melodic instruments or voices. Note that the oscillator only updates
its frequency when it detects a clear pitch. It then maintains this pitch until it detects a new one.
This means that changing the oscillator’s parameters or causing it to reset (when grouping
Vocoder’s track, for example) can cause unexpected changes in the sound. With polyphonic
material or drums, pitch tracking is generally unpredictable (but can be very interesting.)

Particularly when using external carrier sources, a vocoder’s output can sometimes lose a lot of high
end. Enabling the Enhance button results in a brighter sound by normalizing the spectrum and
dynamics of the carrier.

The Unvoiced knob adjusts the volume of an additional noise generator, which is used to resynthesize
portions of the modulator signal that are pitchless, such as ”f” and ”s” sounds.

Sens. sets the sensitivity of the unvoiced detection algorithm. At 100%, the unvoiced noise generator is
always on. At 0%, only the main carrier source is used. The Fast/Slow switch adjusts how quickly
Vocoder switches between unvoiced and voiced detection.

Vocoder’s large central area shows the levels of the individual band-pass filters. Clicking within this
display allows you to attenuate these levels.

The Bands chooser sets the number of filters that will be used. Using more bands results in a more
accurate analysis of the modulator’s frequency content, but requires more CPU.

The Range sliders adjust the frequency range over which the band-pass filters will operate. For most
sources, a fairly large range works well, but you may want to adjust the outer limits if the sound
becomes too piercing or bassy. The BW control sets the bandwidth of the filters. At low percentages,
each filter approaches a single frequency. As you increase the bandwidth, you increase the overlap
of the filter bands. A bandwidth of 100% is the most accurate, but higher or lower settings can create
interesting effects.

The Precise/Retro switch toggles between two types of filter behavior. In Precise mode, all filters have
the same gain and bandwidth. In Retro mode, bands become narrower and louder at higher
frequencies.

Gate sets a threshold for the filterbank. Any bands whose levels are below the threshold will be silent.

The Level slider boosts or cuts Vocoder’s output.

Depth sets how much of the modulator’s amplitude envelope is applied to the carrier’s signal. At 0%,
the modulator’s envelope is discarded. At 200%, only high amplitude peaks will be used. 100%
results in ”classic” vocoding.

The Attack and Release controls set how quickly Vocoder responds to amplitude changes in the
modulator signal. Very fast times preserve the transients of the modulator, but can cause distortion
artifacts.

The Mono/Stereo switches determine how many channels are used for the carrier and modulator. In
Mono mode, both the carrier and modulator are treated as mono sources. Stereo uses a mono
modulator but processes the carrier in stereo. L/R processes both the carrier and modulator signals in
stereo.

The frequencies of the carrier’s filterbank can be shifted up or down via the Formant knob. With voice
as the modulator, small Formant changes can alter the apparent gender of the source.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.

26.42.1 Vocoder Tips

This section explains how to set up the most common Vocoder applications.

26.42.1.1 Singing Synthesizer

The classic vocoder application is the ”singing synthesizer.” To set this up in Live:

1.

2.

3.
4.

5.

6.

Insert Vocoder in the track that contains your vocal material. You can either use a clip that
contains a prerecorded voice clip or, to process a live vocal signal, connect a microphone to a
channel on your audio hardware and choose this as the input source for the track.
Insert a synthesizer such as Analog in another track. Again, you can either create a MIDI clip to
drive this synthesizer or play it live.
Set the vocoder’s Carrier chooser to External.
Select the synthesizer track in the vocoder’s Audio From choosers. (For best results, choose Post
FX in the bottom chooser.)
If you’re creating your synthesizer and vocal material in real time, make sure the Arm button is
enabled on both tracks.
Play the synthesizer as you speak into the microphone. You’ll hear the rhythm of your speech,
but with the timbral character and frequencies of the synthesizer. To hear the vocoded signal
alone, solo the voice track so that the ”normal” synthesizer track is muted.

Note: you’ll generally get the best results if your synthesizer sound is bright and rich in harmonics. Try
sawtooth-based patches to improve the intelligibility of the voice. For even more brightness and
clarity, try adjusting the Unvoiced control and/or enabling Enhance.

26.42.1.2 Formant Shifter

If the Vocoder is set to use the modulator as its own carrier, it can be used as a powerful formant
shifter. To do this:

1.
2.
3.

Set the Carrier chooser to Modulator.
Set the Depth to 100%.
Enable Enhance.

Now experiment with different settings of the Formant knob to alter the character of the source. For
even more sound-sculpting possibilities, try adjusting the various filterbank parameters as well.

27. Live MIDI Effect Reference

Live comes with a selection of custom-designed, built-in MIDI effects. These effects can modify
incoming MIDI pitch, length, and velocity data in various ways. You can use a MIDI effect on its own
to add variation to a pattern or combine multiple MIDI effects to create more complex note
sequences.

All MIDI effects with pitch controls support scale awareness. When the Use Current Scale toggle in the
device title bar is enabled, any pitch-related controls can be adjusted in scale degrees instead of
semitones. This ensures that all note transpositions stay within a specific harmonic range.

To learn the basics of using effects in Live, check out the Working with Instruments and Effects chapter.
