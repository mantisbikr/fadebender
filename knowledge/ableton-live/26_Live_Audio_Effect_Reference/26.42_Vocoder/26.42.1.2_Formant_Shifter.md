# 26.42.1.2 Formant Shifter

If the Vocoder is set to use the modulator as its own carrier, it can be used as a powerful formant
shifter. To do this:

1.
2.
3.

Set the Carrier chooser to Modulator.
Set the Depth to 100%.
Enable Enhance.

Now experiment with different settings of the Formant knob to alter the character of the source. For
even more sound-sculpting possibilities, try adjusting the various filterbank parameters as well.

27. Live MIDI Effect Reference

Live comes with a selection of custom-designed, built-in MIDI effects. These effects can modify
incoming MIDI pitch, length, and velocity data in various ways. You can use a MIDI effect on its own
to add variation to a pattern or combine multiple MIDI effects to create more complex note
sequences.

All MIDI effects with pitch controls support scale awareness. When the Use Current Scale toggle in the
device title bar is enabled, any pitch-related controls can be adjusted in scale degrees instead of
semitones. This ensures that all note transpositions stay within a specific harmonic range.

To learn the basics of using effects in Live, check out the Working with Instruments and Effects chapter.
