# 26.3 Auto Pan

The Auto Pan Effect.

Auto Pan offers LFO-driven manipulation of amplitude and panning for creating automatic panning,
tremolo and amplitude modulation, and beat-synchronized chopping effects.

Auto Pan’s LFOs modulate the amplitude of the left and right stereo channels with sine, triangle,
sawtooth down or random waveforms.

The Shape control pushes the waveform to its upper and lower limits, ”hardening” its shape. The
waveform can be set to ”Normal” or ”Invert” (use ”Invert” to, for example, create the saw up
waveform from the saw down waveform).

LFO speed is controlled with the Rate control, which can be set in terms of hertz. Rate can also be
synced to the song tempo.

Though both LFOs run at the same frequency, the Phase control lends the sound stereo movement by
offsetting their waveforms relative to each other. Set this to ”180”, and the LFOs will be perfectly out
of phase (180 degrees apart), so that when one reaches its peak, the other is at its minimum. Phase is
particularly effective for creating vibrato effects.

The Offset control shifts the start point of each LFO along its waveform.

The device’s influence on incoming signals is set with the Amount control.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
