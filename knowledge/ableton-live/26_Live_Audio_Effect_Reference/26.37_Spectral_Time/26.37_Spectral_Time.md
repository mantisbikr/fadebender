# 26.37 Spectral Time

The Spectral Time Effect.

Spectral Time combines time freezing and spectral delay effects in a single inspiring device. You can
resynthesize your sounds by applying various spectral filters, delays and frequency-shifting techniques
to incoming material, creating highly varied and unique copies. The freeze and delay effects can be
used together or independently, allowing for a wide range of possibilities, such as sustaining any
sound infinitely, or combining delays with time-synced fade transitions. You can easily transform
sounds by smearing frequencies over time, or add metallic echoes and space to any sound source.

Spectral Time has two main sections, Freezer and Delay, which can be used individually or serially,
with the freezer feeding the delay. You can toggle the individual sections using the Freezer On and
Delay On buttons.

Spectral Time uses a spectrogram to display how frequencies in the dry and wet signals behave over
time. Dry signals are represented in yellow, while wet signals are shown in blue. You can hide the
visualization by clicking on its toggle button.

From Spectral Time’s context menu, you can switch Zero Dry Signal Latency on or off. Enabling it
reduces the latency of the dry signal to zero instead of syncing it with the output of the effect. This
option is useful when playing a live instrument through Spectral Time and monitoring the output.

26.37.1 Freezer Section

Spectral Time’s Freezer Section.

Depending on which of the Manual/Retrigger Mode buttons are activated, the Freezer section
controls how the freeze function is triggered and how certain temporal characteristics of the frozen
audio are affected. Note that for both modes, the Freeze button also has to be toggled in order for the
effect to occur.

In Manual mode, audio can be frozen by clicking on the Freeze button. You can also control the Fade
In and Fade Out time of the frozen signal in milliseconds.

In Retrigger mode, you have more controls to fine-tune the rhythm of the frozen audio, which can be
frozen automatically at every transient (onset), or at regular intervals.

Onsets mode will freeze the audio after a transient is detected in the input. Use the Sensitivity knob to
adjust the sensitivity of onset detection. Sensitivity is highest at 100% and lowest at 0%.

Sync mode will freeze the audio at regular intervals, determined by the Interval control. By toggling
the Freezer Time Unit buttons, the Interval control can be set to either milliseconds or beat-time values.

In both Onsets and Sync modes, the Freezer Fade Shape buttons toggle between two available fade
shapes: Crossfade and Envelope. Both fade shapes have different controls to determine how a new
freeze will fade in and out.

When the Crossfade shape is selected, the new freeze will fade in and the old freeze (or dry signal)
will fade out. The crossfade duration is set by the X-Fade control, which specifically determines the
time in milliseconds over which a new freeze will fade in as a percentage of the sync interval set by
the Interval control.

When the Envelope shape is selected, a new freeze will fade in and out according to the millisecond
time values chosen in the Fade In and Fade Out parameters. In this mode, up to eight simultaneous
freezes can be stacked on top of one another.

26.37.2 Delay Section

Spectral Time’s Delay Section.

The Delay section of Spectral Time can be activated or deactivated with the Delay toggle button and
allows you to create delayed copies of spectral information. If the Freezer section is enabled, the
Delay section will be fed by the Freezer’s output.

The Time parameter controls the delay time for the spectral delay lines. The type of value shown here
is dependent on the unit type chosen in the “Mode” drop-down chooser:

•
•
•

Time mode adjusts the delay time in milliseconds.
Notes adjusts delay time in beat divisions.
16th, 16th Triplet, and 16th Dotted set the delay time to the number of the chosen type of 16th
notes.

Feedback sets the amount of output that is fed back to the delay input. Turning this up increases the
audible echoes of the signal.

Shift shifts the frequency of the delayed signals. Each successive delay will be shifted up or down by
the specified frequency amount.

Stereo adjusts the width of the Tilt and Spray controls.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the delayed and dry signals. Note that this only
affects the Delay section of the device.

Tilt skews the delay times for different frequencies. A positive value will delay high frequencies more
than low frequencies, while a negative value delays low frequencies more than high frequencies.

Spray distributes the delay times for different frequencies randomly within the given time range.

Mask limits the effects of the Tilt and Spray controls to either high or low frequencies. Positive values
limit the effects to high frequencies, while negative values limit the effects to low frequencies.

26.37.3 Resolution Section

Spectral Time’s Resolution Control.

In the upper right corner of the spectrogram display, you will find the Resolution control, which sets the
resolution used to process the incoming signal. Lower values reduce the overall latency at the cost of
accuracy and fidelity. Note that since higher values affect overall latency, you may wish to reduce the
Resolution while tracking.

26.37.4 Global Controls

Spectral Time’s Global Controls.

Input Send adjusts the gain of the input signal.

The two radio buttons Frz > Dly and Dly > Frz reverse the effect order.

The global Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to
100% when using Spectral Time in a return track.

26.38 Spectrum

The Spectrum Device.

Spectrum performs real-time frequency analysis of incoming audio signals. The results are represented
in a graph, with dB along the vertical axis and frequency/pitch along the horizontal. The peak levels
are retained on the graph until the song is restarted. Note that Spectrum is not an audio effect, but
rather a measurement tool — it does not alter the incoming signal in any way.

The Block chooser selects the number of samples that will be analyzed in each measurement. Higher
values result in better accuracy, but at the expense of increased CPU load.

Channel determines which channel is analyzed — left, right or both.

The Refresh slider determines how often Spectrum should perform an analysis. As with the Block
parameter, this allows for a tradeoff between accuracy and CPU load. A fast response time is more
accurate, but also more CPU intensive.

The Avg slider allows you to specify how many blocks of samples will be averaged for each update
of the display. With a setting of one, each block is shown. This results in much more activity in the
display, which can be useful for finding the spectrum of short peaks. As you increase the Avg value,
the display updates more smoothly, providing an average of the spectrum over time. This is more
consistent with the way we actually hear.

The Graph button switches between displaying the spectrum as a single interpolated line and discrete
frequency bins.

Max toggles the display of the accumulated maximum amplitude. With Max enabled, you can reset
the maximum amplitude by clicking in the display.

The Scale X buttons allow you to toggle the scaling of the frequency display between linear,
logarithmic, and semitone. Note that logarithmic and semitone are actually the same scaling, but

switch the legending at the top of the display between Hertz and note names. Linear scaling is
particularly useful for detailed analysis of high frequencies.

As you move your mouse over Spectrum’s display, a box appears that shows the amplitude,
frequency and note name at the pointer’s position. The Range/Auto button at the bottom left of
Spectrum’s interface toggles between manually and automatically adjusting the display’s dynamic
range. With Range selected, you can zoom and scroll the amplitude by moving your mouse over the
amplitude legending on the display’s left side. Drag vertically to scroll and horizontally to zoom. You
can also use the Range sliders to set the minimum and maximum amplitude values shown. With Auto
selected, the display automatically scales itself based on the incoming audio level. Note that in Auto
mode, the Range sliders and zooming are disabled.

To get an even better view, you can toggle the location of the display between the device chain and
Live’s main window by clicking the
display.
