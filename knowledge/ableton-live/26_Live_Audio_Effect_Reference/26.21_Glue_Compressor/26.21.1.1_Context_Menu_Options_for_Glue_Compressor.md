# 26.21.1.1 Context Menu Options for Glue Compressor

Oversampling can be toggled on or off via the device title bar’s context menu. Enabling this option
causes the Glue Compressor to internally process at two times the current sampling rate, which may
reduce aliasing and transient harshness. There is a slight increase in CPU usage with Oversampling
enabled. Note that with Oversampling enabled, the level may exceed 0 dB even with Soft clip
enabled.
