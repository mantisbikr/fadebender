# 26.12 Drum Buss

The Drum Buss Effect.

Drum Buss is an analog-style drum processor that was designed to add body and character to a
group of drums, while gluing them together in a tight mix.

The Trim slider lets you reduce the input level before any processing is applied to the signal.

The Comp toggle applies a fixed compressor to the input signal before it is processed by the
distortion. The compressor is optimized for balancing out groups of drums, with fast attack, medium
release and moderate ratio settings, as well as ample makeup gain.

There are three types of distortion which can be applied to the input signal. Each distortion type adds
an increasing degree of distortion, while lending its own character to the overall sound:

•
•
•

Soft: waveshaping distortion
Medium: limiting distortion
Hard: clipping distortion with bass boost

For more intensity, it is possible to drive the input prior to distorting it. The Drive control lets you
determine how much drive is applied to the input signal.

Drum Buss combines commonly-used drum processing tools for shaping the mid-high range and filling
out the low end, which we will look at in the following sections.

26.12.0.1 Mid-High Frequency Shaping

The mid-high frequency shaping tools are designed to add clarity and presence to drums such as
snares and hi-hats.

Crunch adjusts the amount of sine-shaped distortion applied to mid-high frequencies.

The Damp control is a low-pass filter, which removes unwanted high frequencies that can occur after
adding distortion.

The Transients knob emphasizes or de-emphasizes the transients of frequencies above 100 Hz.
Positive values add attack and increase sustain, resulting in a full, “punchy” sound. Negative values
also add attack, but decrease sustain. This tightens up the drums, giving them a sharper, more crisp
sound with less room and rattle.

Low-End Enhancement

Drum Buss’s low-end enhancement is made up of two tools: a resonant filter, which dramatically
boosts bass frequencies, as well as a Decay control, which allows you to adjust the decay rate of both
the incoming audio and the signal processed by the resonant filter. These tools help you to fill out the
low-end of your drums.

The Boom knob adjusts the amount of low-end enhancement that the resonant filter produces. The
Bass Meter lets you see the Boom’s effect on the signal, which can be particularly useful if you can’t
hear it.

The Freq knob adjusts the frequency of the low-end enhancer. Force To Note lets you tune the low-end
enhancer by setting its frequency to the value of the nearest MIDI note.

The Decay control adjusts the decay rate of the low frequencies. When the Boom amount is set to 0%,
the decay affects the incoming (post-drive and distortion) signal only. When the “Boom Level” is
adjusted above 0%, the decay affects both the incoming and processed signals.

To solo the result of the low-frequency enhancer, enable Boom Audition via the headphone icon.

26.12.0.2 Output

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.

The Output Gain slider sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
