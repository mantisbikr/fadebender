# 26.23.4.2 Quartz

The Quartz algorithm is a hall-like reverb with some audible echoes in the reverb’s tail. This reverb has
a very clear replication of the input in the early reflections and is well suited for voices, drums and
signals with clear transients, as well as making echoes.

In addition to the shared parameters listed above, Quartz also provides the following:

•

•

•

Damping controls the amount of high-frequency filtering within the reverb algorithms. Higher
values result in darker reverberation sounds.
Lo Damp controls the amount of low frequency filtering within the reverb algorithms. Higher
values result in brighter reverberation sounds.
Mod controls the amount of movement within the algorithm’s reverb tail. Less modulation
produces less movement, and more modulation creates more movement with a chorusing effect,
while diminishing the effect of resonances.

•

•

Diffusion controls the density of the algorithm’s reverb tail. Low values produce sparser tails,
while higher values produce denser tails.
Distance controls the virtual distance of reflections. Lower values put them closer to the listener
and increase their density while higher values place them farther away and increase the time
between echoes.
