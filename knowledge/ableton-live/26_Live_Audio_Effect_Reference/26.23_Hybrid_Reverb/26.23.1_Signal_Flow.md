# 26.23.1 Signal Flow

You can imagine signals being processed by Hybrid Reverb as flowing from the left side of the device
towards the right side, passing first through the input section, then into the reverb engines. The
relationship between the two reverb engines is affected by the routing section, after which the signal
passes through the EQ section, and then finally to the output.

The convolution reverb engine’s controls are yellow in color, while the algorithmic engine’s controls
are displayed in blue.
