# 26.23.4.1 Dark Hall

The Dark Hall algorithm is a smooth and classic sounding algorithm suitable for most medium to long
sounding halls.

In addition to the shared parameters listed above, Dark Hall also provides the following:

•

•

•

•

•

Damping controls the amount of high-frequency filtering within the reverb algorithms. Higher
values result in darker reverberation sounds.
Mod controls the amount of movement within the algorithm’s reverb tail. Less modulation
produces less movement, and more modulation creates more movement with a chorusing effect,
while diminishing the effect of resonances.
Shape transforms the artificial space’s sonic characteristics from small and resonant to large
and diffused.
Bass X controls the crossover frequency of the low-end part of the reverb tail, which is scaled
using the Bass Mult control.
Bass Mult scales the decay time of the low-end of the reverb tail.

In Dark Hall mode, long decay times combined with extremely small Size values create metallic
gong-like resonances.
