# 26.35.6.1 Pitch-shifted Drum Layers

To add glitchy, metallic echoes to a drum loop, duplicate your drum track and add Shifter after the
Drum Rack. In Pitch mode, try adjusting or automating the Coarse knob and enable the Delay button.
Higher pitch shifts will create a metallic and crisp echoed delay. Lower pitch shifts will create a
drawn-out delay effect. You can lower the volume of the pitch-shifted track so that it sits in the
background, adding some movement to the main drum track.
