# 26.35.4 Shifter Mode Section

The Shifter Mode Section.

Three different Shifter Mode button switches are available: Pitch, Freq, and Ring.

Pitch mode adjusts the pitch of incoming audio up or down by a user-specified amount in semitones
(Coarse tuning) and cents (Fine tuning).

Freq mode moves the frequencies of incoming audio up or down by a user-specified amount in Hertz.
Small amounts of shift can result in subtle tremolo or phasing effects, while large shifts can create
dissonant, metallic sounds.

In Ring mode, the user-specified frequency amount in Hertz is added to and subtracted from the input.

Drive enables a distortion effect, and the slider below it controls the level of the distortion. Note: Drive
is only available in Ring mode.

The Dry/Wet knob sets the balance between the dry and processed signals at Shifter’s output.
