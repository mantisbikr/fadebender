# 26.35 Shifter

The Shifter Effect.

Shifter is a multi-purpose pitch and frequency-shifting audio effect that can be used to add ring
modulation to incoming audio or to shift the pitch or frequency of audio in real time.

26.35.1 Tuning and Delay Section

Shifter’s Tuning and Delay Section.

The Coarse and Fine knobs adjust the pitch or frequency in the given value, depending on which shift
mode (explained in the Shifter Mode section) is selected.

Enabling the Wide button inverts the polarity of the Spread value for the right channel, creating a
stereo effect. This means that increasing the Spread value will shift the frequency down in the right
channel while shifting it up in the left. Note that Wide has no effect if the Spread value is set to 0.

In Pitch mode, the Window slider adjusts the window size used by the algorithm. Low frequency
signals often sound best with longer window sizes, while high frequencies often sound best with
shorter window sizes. Tone cuts the high frequencies of the delay’s feedback path.

Enabling the Delay button adds delay time that can be set using the slider control in Hertz or beat-
synced divisions, depending on which Delay Mode button you select. The Delay Feedback knob sets
the amount of the output that is fed back to the input of the delay.

26.35.2 LFO Section

Shifter’s LFO Section.

You can modulate the left and right stereo channels using Shifter’s LFO.

In the LFO waveform display, you can set the Duty Cycle and Phase/Spin/Width controls. Duty
Cycle sets the duty cycle of the LFO waveform. Phase adjusts the offset between the waveforms for the
left and right channel. At 180° the LFOs will be perfectly out of phase. Depending on the LFO
waveform or the Rate parameter, Phase may be replaced by a Spin or Width control, as explained
below.

When the Rate parameter (as described in further detail below) is set to beat-synced time divisions,
you will see the Offset parameter next to the Phase parameter, which shifts the starting point of each
LFO along its waveform.

There are several different LFO waveforms to choose from the LFO drop-down menu: Sine, Triangle,
Triangle Analog, Triangle 8, Triangle 16, Saw Up, Saw Down, Rectangle, Random, and Random
S&H.

The LFO waveforms Sine, Triangle, Triangle Analog, Triangle 8, Triangle 16, Saw Up, Saw Down, and
Rectangle can also be set to Spin instead of Phase. Spin detunes the two LFO speeds relative to one
another.

The LFO waveforms Random and Random S&H can only be set to Phase and Width, respectively.
Width adjusts the Stereo width of the random LFO waveform. At 0%, the waveform is identical for the
left and right channels. At 100%, the waveform is fully stereo, peaks on the left will correspond to
valleys on the right and vice versa.

LFO modulation is controlled with the Rate parameter, which can be set in Hertz or synced to the song
tempo and set in meter subdivisions (e.g. sixteenth notes). The Amount parameter sets the amount of
LFO modulation that is applied to incoming signals.

26.35.3 Envelope Follower Section

Shifter’s Envelope Follower.

Shifter’s envelope follower uses the amplitude from an incoming audio signal and translates it to a
modulation source.

The Envelope Attack sets how quickly the envelope follower responds to rising input levels and the
Envelope Release sets how quickly the envelope follower responds to falling input levels.

The Env Fol button switches on Shifter’s envelope follower. The Amount adjusts the intensity of the
envelope follower’s modulation. The Amount value can be set in semitones in Pitch mode or in Hertz in
the Freq and Ring modes.

26.35.4 Shifter Mode Section

The Shifter Mode Section.

Three different Shifter Mode button switches are available: Pitch, Freq, and Ring.

Pitch mode adjusts the pitch of incoming audio up or down by a user-specified amount in semitones
(Coarse tuning) and cents (Fine tuning).

Freq mode moves the frequencies of incoming audio up or down by a user-specified amount in Hertz.
Small amounts of shift can result in subtle tremolo or phasing effects, while large shifts can create
dissonant, metallic sounds.

In Ring mode, the user-specified frequency amount in Hertz is added to and subtracted from the input.

Drive enables a distortion effect, and the slider below it controls the level of the distortion. Note: Drive
is only available in Ring mode.

The Dry/Wet knob sets the balance between the dry and processed signals at Shifter’s output.

26.35.5 Sidechain Parameters

Shifter’s Sidechain Parameters.

To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold the Shifter window by toggling the triangle button on the
left of the title bar. There are two Pitch Modes available that determine how the pitch or frequency is
set: Internal and MIDI. In Internal mode, the pitch or frequency is set by Shifter’s Coarse and Fine
knobs. In MIDI mode, the pitch or frequency is set by an incoming MIDI note.

In MIDI mode, you will see a drop-down menu where you can select an external MIDI source. There
is also a Glide parameter that adjusts the time in milliseconds over which it takes notes to slide their
pitch to the next incoming pitch. You can set a pitch bend range between 0-24 semitones to define the
effect of MIDI pitch bend messages using the PB slider.

26.35.6 Shifter Tips

26.35.6.1 Pitch-shifted Drum Layers

To add glitchy, metallic echoes to a drum loop, duplicate your drum track and add Shifter after the
Drum Rack. In Pitch mode, try adjusting or automating the Coarse knob and enable the Delay button.
Higher pitch shifts will create a metallic and crisp echoed delay. Lower pitch shifts will create a
drawn-out delay effect. You can lower the volume of the pitch-shifted track so that it sits in the
background, adding some movement to the main drum track.

26.35.6.2 Phasing Effects

To create lush phasing effects, minimally adjust (no more than 2 Hz or so) the Fine knob in Freq mode.
Phasing is caused by the interaction of the processed and dry signals; you can adjust the Mix balance
so that both are audible. The strongest phasing will be heard when MIx is at 50%.

26.35.6.3 Tremolo Effects

In Ring mode, frequencies below the audible range (about 20 Hz or slightly lower) create a tremolo
effect. You can also impart a sense of stereo motion to the tremolo by turning on Wide and using small
Spread values.
