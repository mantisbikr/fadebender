# 26.35.6.2 Phasing Effects

To create lush phasing effects, minimally adjust (no more than 2 Hz or so) the Fine knob in Freq mode.
Phasing is caused by the interaction of the processed and dry signals; you can adjust the Mix balance
so that both are audible. The strongest phasing will be heard when MIx is at 50%.
