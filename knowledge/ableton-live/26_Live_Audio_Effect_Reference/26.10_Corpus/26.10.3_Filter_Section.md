# 26.10.3 Filter Section

Corpus’s Filter Section.

The processed signal can be fed through a band-pass filter that can be toggled on or off with the Filter
switch.

The Freq knob adjusts the center frequency of the filter while Bdwidth adjusts the bandwidth of the
filter.

26.10.4 Global Parameters

Corpus’s Global Parameters.

Bleed mixes a portion of the unprocessed signal with the resonated signal. At higher values, more of
the original signal is applied. This is useful for restoring high frequencies, which can often be damped
when the tuning or quality are set to low values. This parameter is deactivated with the Pipe or Tube
resonators.

Gain boosts or attenuates the level of the processed signal. Corpus contains a built-in limiter that
automatically activates when the audio level is too high. This is indicated by the LED next to the Gain
knob.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the dry input signal and the signal sent to Corpus’s
processing. Turning Dry/Wet down will not cut resonances that are currently sounding, but rather stop
new input signals from being processed.
