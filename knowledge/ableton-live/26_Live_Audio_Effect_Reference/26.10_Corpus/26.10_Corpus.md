# 26.10 Corpus

The Corpus Effect.

Corpus is an effect that simulates the acoustic characteristics of seven types of resonant objects.
Developed in collaboration with Applied Acoustics Systems, Corpus uses physical modeling
technology to provide a wide range of parameters and modulation options.

26.10.1 Resonator Parameters

Corpus’s Resonator Parameters.

The Resonance Type chooser allows you to select from seven types of physically modeled resonant
objects:

•
•

•
•

Beam simulates the resonance properties of beams of different materials and sizes.
Marimba, a specialized variant of the Beam model, reproduces the characteristic tuning of
marimba bar overtones which are produced as a result of the deep arch-cut of the bars.
String simulates the sound produced by strings of different materials and sizes.
Membrane is a model of a rectangular membrane (such as a drum head) with a variable size
and construction.
Plate simulates sound production by a rectangular plate (a flat surface) of different materials
and sizes.
Pipe simulates a cylindrical tube that is fully open at one end and has a variable opening at the
other (adjusted with the Opening parameter).
Tube simulates a cylindrical tube that is fully open at both ends.

The Resonator Quality chooser controls the trade-off between the sound quality of the resonators and
performance by reducing the number of overtones that are calculated. Eco uses minimal CPU
resources, while High creates more sophisticated resonances. This parameter is not used with the Pipe
or Tube resonators.

The Decay slider adjusts the amount of internal damping in the resonator, and thus the decay time.

The Material slider adjusts the variation of the damping at different frequencies. At lower values, low
frequency components decay slower than high frequency components (which simulates objects made
of wood, nylon or rubber). At higher values, high frequency components decay slower (which
simulates objects made of glass or metal). This parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.

The Radius slider is only available for the Pipe and Tube resonators, and appears in place of the
Material parameter mentioned above. Radius adjusts the radius of the pipe or tube. As the radius
increases, the decay time and high frequency sustain both increase. At very large sizes, the
fundamental pitch of the resonator also changes.

The Decay and Material/Radius parameters can also be controlled with the X-Y controller.

The Bright knob adjusts the amplitude of various frequency components. At higher values, higher
frequencies are louder. This parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.

Inharm (Inharmonics) adjusts the pitch of the resonator’s harmonics. At negative values, frequencies
are compressed, increasing the number of lower partials. At positive values, frequencies are stretched,
increasing the number of upper partials. This parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.

Opening, which is only available for the Pipe resonator, scales between an open and closed pipe. At
0%, the pipe is fully closed on one side, while at 100% the pipe is open at both ends.

Ratio, which is only available for the Membrane and Plate resonators, adjusts the ratio of the
membrane/plate along its x and y axes.

The Hit knob adjusts the location on the resonator at which the object is struck or otherwise activated.
At 0%, the object is hit at its center. Higher values move the activation point closer to the edge. This
parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.

The Width slider adjusts the stereo mix between the left and right resonators. At 0%, both resonators
are fed equally to each side, resulting in mono output. At 100%, each resonator is sent exclusively to
one channel.

The Pos. L and Pos. R controls adjust the location on the left and right resonator where the vibrations
are measured. At 0%, the resonance is monitored at the object’s center. Higher values move the
listening point closer to the edge. These parameters are not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators,
which are always measured in the middle of their permanently open end.

The Tune knob adjusts the frequency of the resonator in Hertz. When MIDI Frequency is enabled in
Corpus’s Sidechain section, the knob can be used to adjust the coarse tuning of the MIDI modulation.

The Fine knob allows for fine tuning MIDI modulation in cents when sidechain MIDI Frequency is
enabled.

Spread detunes the two resonators in relation to each other. Positive values raise the pitch of the left
resonator while lowering the pitch of the right one, while negative values do the opposite. At 0%, the
resonators are tuned the same.

26.10.2 LFO Section

Corpus’s LFO Section.

Corpus contains a Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) to modulate the resonant frequency. The Amount
control sets how much the LFO affects the frequency.

The Rate control specifies the LFO speed. It can be set in terms of Hertz, or synced to the song tempo,
allowing for controlled rhythmic modulation.

Available LFO waveform shapes are sine (creates smooth modulations with rounded peaks and
valleys), square, triangle, sawtooth up, sawtooth down and two types of noise (stepped and smooth).

Although only one set of LFO controls is visible, there are actually two LFOs, one for each stereo
channel. The Phase and Spin controls define the relationship between these two LFOs.

Phase keeps both LFOs at the same frequency, but can set the two LFO waveforms ”out of phase” with
each other, creating stereo movement. When set to 180, the LFO outputs are 180 degrees apart, so
that when one LFO reaches its peak, the other is at its minimum. With Phase set to 360 or 0 the two
LFOs run in sync.

When the LFOs are synced to song tempo, an additional Offset knob is available, which shifts the start
point of the LFO along its waveform.

Spin (only available when the LFOs are in Hertz mode) detunes the two LFO speeds relative to each
other. Each stereo channel is modulated at a different frequency, as determined by the Spin amount.

Phase or Spin can be chosen when the LFOs are in Hertz mode using the LFO Stereo mode icons.

The LFO Stereo Mode Icons.

For the noise waveforms, the Phase and Spin controls are not relevant and do not affect the sound.

26.10.3 Filter Section

Corpus’s Filter Section.

The processed signal can be fed through a band-pass filter that can be toggled on or off with the Filter
switch.

The Freq knob adjusts the center frequency of the filter while Bdwidth adjusts the bandwidth of the
filter.

26.10.4 Global Parameters

Corpus’s Global Parameters.

Bleed mixes a portion of the unprocessed signal with the resonated signal. At higher values, more of
the original signal is applied. This is useful for restoring high frequencies, which can often be damped
when the tuning or quality are set to low values. This parameter is deactivated with the Pipe or Tube
resonators.

Gain boosts or attenuates the level of the processed signal. Corpus contains a built-in limiter that
automatically activates when the audio level is too high. This is indicated by the LED next to the Gain
knob.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the dry input signal and the signal sent to Corpus’s
processing. Turning Dry/Wet down will not cut resonances that are currently sounding, but rather stop
new input signals from being processed.

26.10.5 Sidechain Parameters

Corpus’s Sidechain Parameters.

The frequency and/or decay rate of the resonance can be MIDI-modulated by enabling the
Frequency and/or Off Decay switches in the Sidechain section. Toggle the
bar to access Sidechain parameters. This button will light up if the sidechain is active.

The MIDI From choosers allow you to select the MIDI track and tapping point from which to receive
MIDI note information.

With Frequency enabled, the tuning of the resonance is determined by the incoming MIDI note. If
multiple notes are held simultaneously, the Last/Low switch determines whether the last or the lowest
note will have priority. The Transpose and Fine knobs in the Resonator section allow for coarse and
fine offset of the MIDI-modulated tuning. PB Range sets the range in semitones of pitch bend
modulation.

With Frequency deactivated, the Tune control in the Resonator section adjusts the base frequency of
the resonance in Hertz. The corresponding MIDI note number and fine tuning offset in cents is
displayed below.

Enabling Off Decay causes MIDI Note Off messages to mute the resonance. The slider below the
switch determines the extent to which MIDI Note Off messages mute the resonance. At 0%, Note Offs
are ignored, and the decay time is based only on the value of the Decay parameter, which can be
adjusted using the X-Y controller or Decay slider. This is similar to how real-world mallet instruments
such as marimbas and glockenspiels behave. At 100%, the resonance is muted immediately at Note
Off, regardless of the Decay time.
