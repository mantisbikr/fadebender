# 26.11 Delay

The Delay Effect.

The Delay provides two independent delay lines, one for each channel (left and right).

To refer delay time to the song tempo, activate the Sync switch, which allows using the Delay Time
beat division chooser. The numbered switches represent time delay in 16th notes. For example,
selecting ”4” delays the signal by four 16th notes, which equals one beat (a quarter note) of delay.

If the Sync switch is off, the delay time reverts to milliseconds. In this case, to edit the delay time, click
and drag up the Delay Time knob.

With Stereo Link engaged, the left channel’s settings are applied to the right channel, and changing
either channel’s Sync switch or Delay Time settings will apply the changes to both sides.

The Feedback parameter defines how much of each channel’s output signal feeds back into the delay
lines’ inputs. Internally, they are two independent feedback loops, so a signal on the left channel does
not feed back into the right channel and vice versa.

 button will cause the delay to endlessly cycle the audio which is in its buffer at the moment

The
that the button is pressed, ignoring any new input until Freeze is disabled.

The delay is preceded by a band-pass filter that can be toggled on and off with a switch, and
controlled with an X-Y controller. To define the filter bandwidth, click and drag on the vertical axis. To
set the position of the frequency band, click and drag on the horizontal axis.

Filter frequency and delay time can be modulated by an LFO, making it possible to achieve a range
of sounds from light chorus-like effects through to heavy contorted noise. The Rate slider sets the
frequency of the modulation oscillator in Hertz. The Filter slider adjusts the amount of modulation that
is applied to the filter, and the Time slider adjusts the amount of modulation that is applied to the delay
time.

Changing the delay time while Delay is processing audio can cause abrupt changes in the sound of
the delayed signal. You can choose between three delay transition modes:

•

•

•

Repitch causes a pitch variation when changing the delay time, similar to the behavior of old
tape delay units. Repitch mode is the default option.
Fade creates a crossfade between the old and new delay times. This sounds a bit similar to time
stretching if the delay time is gradually changed.
Jump immediately jumps to the new delay time. Note that this will cause an audible click if the
delay time is changed while delays are sounding.

Tip: Try using the Time slider to explore the effect of time modulation on the different transition modes.

When the Ping Pong switch is activated, the signal jumps from the left to the right output.

The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100
percent when using Delay in a return track. The Dry/Wet parameter’s context menu lets you toggle
Equal-Loudness. When enabled, a 50/50 mix will sound equally loud for most signals.

Sets saved in versions of Live older than Live 10.1 that used Simple Delay or Ping Pong Delay devices
will show an Upgrade button in the title bar of each instance of Delay when loading the Set.
Upgrading the device will preserve the previously used device’s free delay time range, and will only
affect the sound of the Set or preset if the free delay time parameter was either mapped to a Macro
Control or to a Max for Live device.

26.11.1 Delay Tips

26.11.1.1 Glitch Effect

Enable the Stereo Link switch and set the delay time to around 400-500ms. Dial the Feedback to
80% or above. Disable the band-pass filter, adjust the Filter slider to 0%, and set the Time slider to
100%. Select the Fade transition mode and make sure Ping Pong is disabled. Set the Dry/Wet control
to 80% or above.

26.11.1.2 Chorus Effect

Disable the Stereo Link switch, set the left channel’s delay time to 12ms, and adjust the right channel’s
delay time to 17ms. Dial the Feedback to 60%. Enable the band-pass filter, set the Filter Frequency to
750 Hz, and adjust the Width slider to 6.5. Set the Rate slider to 5 Hz, bring the Filter slider to 10%,
and dial the Time slider to 12%. Select the Repitch transition mode and enable the Ping Pong switch.


## Fadebender Device Structure & Operational Logic

**Source**: This section augments the verbatim manual text by describing UI-derived structure and explicit conditional behavior. No values are invented; if ranges or scaling were not documented, they are omitted.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

### Control Groups (UI-Based Functional Clustering)

_No explicit sub-groups beyond the main description were detected in this section._

### Parameter Typing (Only When Explicitly Documented)

> If the manual explicitly states toggle/On‑Off, stepped/quantized lists, or continuous controls with documented ranges, include them below. Otherwise left blank.

| Parameter | Type | Display Range | Normalized Range | Scaling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

### Master / Dependent Parameter Relationships (Quoted Conditions)

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

### No-Effect-Until Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
