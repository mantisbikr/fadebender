# 26.32 Reverb

The Reverb Effect.

Reverb is an audio effect that simulates the acoustic properties of audio as it echoes throughout a
physical space.

In the real world, reverberation exists as a product of sound waves that reflect off of rigid surfaces in
an environment and the subsequent tonal shaping of these waves by absorbent materials within their
trajectory. In a digital context, however, this phenomenon is approximated with a combination of
filters and modulated delay lines.

The Reverb device provides granular control of all of these factors in order to create unique spaces for
audio to travel through that range from intimate recording rooms to massive canyons, and everything
in between.

26.32.1 Input Filter

Reverb’s Input Filter Section.

The input signal passes first through low and high cut filters, whose X-Y controller allows changing the
band’s center frequency (X-axis) and bandwidth (Y-axis). The filters can also be controlled using the
sliders located below the X-Y controller. Either filter may be switched off when not needed to save
CPU power.

26.32.2 Early Reflections

Reverb’s Early Reflections Section.

These are the earliest echoes that you hear after they bounce off a room’s walls, before the onset of
the diffused reverberation tail. Their amplitude and distribution give an impression of the room’s
character.

Spin applies modulation to the early reflections. The Amount and Rate sliders control the amount and
rate of these modulations respectively. A higher Amount setting tends to provide a less-colored (more
spectrally neutral) late diffusion response. If the modulation rate is too high, doppler frequency shifting
of the source sound will occur, along with surreal panning effects. Spin may be turned off, using the
associated switch, for modest CPU savings.

The Shape control sculpts the prominence of the early reflections, as well as their overlap with the
diffused sound. With small values, the reflections decay more gradually and the diffused sound occurs

sooner, leading to a larger overlap between these components. With large values, the reflections
decay more rapidly and the diffused onset occurs later. A higher value can sometimes improve the
source’s intelligibility, while a lower value may give a smoother decay.

26.32.3 Diffusion Network

Reverb’s Diffusion Network Section.

The Diffusion Network creates the reverberant tail that follows the early reflections.

High and low shelving filters provide frequency-dependent reverberation decay. The high-frequency
decay models the absorption of sound energy due to air, walls and other materials in the room
(people, carpeting and so forth). The low shelf provides a thinner decay. Each filter may be turned off
to save CPU consumption.

The Diffusion and Scale parameters provide additional control over the diffusion’s density and
coarseness, and, when the room size is extremely small, have a large impact on the coloration
contributed by the diffusion.

26.32.4 Chorus

Reverb’s Chorus Section.

The Chorus section adds a little modulation and motion to the diffusion. You can control the
modulation Amount and Rate, or deactivate it altogether.

26.32.5 Global Settings

Reverb’s Global Settings.

Predelay controls the delay time, in milliseconds, before the onset of the first early reflection. This
delays the reverberation relative to the input signal. One’s impression of the size of a real room
depends partly on this delay. Typical values for natural sounds range from 1 ms to 25 ms.

The Smooth chooser specifies the behavior of the Size parameter when its value is adjusted. If set to
None, the Diffusion Network’s delay times are changed immediately, which can cause artifacts when
changing the Size value. If set to Slow or Fast, new delay times are updated over a specific time
period, which results in a smoother sound when transitioning between values.

The Size parameter controls the room’s volume. At one extreme, a very large size will lend a shifting,
diffused delay effect to the reverb. The other extreme — a very small value — will give it a highly
colored, metallic feel.

The Decay control adjusts the time required for this reverb tail to drop to 1/1000th (-60 dB) of its
initial amplitude.

The Freeze control freezes the diffuse response of the input sound. When on, the reverberation will
sustain almost endlessly. Flat bypasses the high and low shelf filters when Freeze is on. If Flat is off, the
frozen reverberation will lose energy in the attenuated frequency bands, depending on the state of the
high and low shelving filters. Cut modifies Freeze by preventing the input signal from adding to the
frozen reverberation; when off, the input signal will contribute to the diffused amplitude.

The Stereo control determines the width of the output’s stereo image. At the highest setting of 120
degrees, each ear receives a reverberant channel that is independent of the other (this is also a
property of the diffusion in real rooms). The lowest setting mixes the output signal to mono.

The Density chooser controls the tradeoff between reverb quality and performance. Sparse uses
minimal CPU resources, while High delivers the richest reverberation.

26.32.6 Output

Reverb’s Output Section.

At the reverb output, you can vary the amplitude of reflections and diffusion with the Reflect and
Diffuse controls and adjust the effect’s overall Dry/Wet mix.
