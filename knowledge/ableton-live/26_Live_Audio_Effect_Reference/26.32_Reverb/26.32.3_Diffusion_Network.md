# 26.32.3 Diffusion Network

Reverb’s Diffusion Network Section.

The Diffusion Network creates the reverberant tail that follows the early reflections.

High and low shelving filters provide frequency-dependent reverberation decay. The high-frequency
decay models the absorption of sound energy due to air, walls and other materials in the room
(people, carpeting and so forth). The low shelf provides a thinner decay. Each filter may be turned off
to save CPU consumption.

The Diffusion and Scale parameters provide additional control over the diffusion’s density and
coarseness, and, when the room size is extremely small, have a large impact on the coloration
contributed by the diffusion.
