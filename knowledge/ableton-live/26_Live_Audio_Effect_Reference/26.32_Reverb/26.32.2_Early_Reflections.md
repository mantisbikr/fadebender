# 26.32.2 Early Reflections

Reverb’s Early Reflections Section.

These are the earliest echoes that you hear after they bounce off a room’s walls, before the onset of
the diffused reverberation tail. Their amplitude and distribution give an impression of the room’s
character.

Spin applies modulation to the early reflections. The Amount and Rate sliders control the amount and
rate of these modulations respectively. A higher Amount setting tends to provide a less-colored (more
spectrally neutral) late diffusion response. If the modulation rate is too high, doppler frequency shifting
of the source sound will occur, along with surreal panning effects. Spin may be turned off, using the
associated switch, for modest CPU savings.

The Shape control sculpts the prominence of the early reflections, as well as their overlap with the
diffused sound. With small values, the reflections decay more gradually and the diffused sound occurs

sooner, leading to a larger overlap between these components. With large values, the reflections
decay more rapidly and the diffused onset occurs later. A higher value can sometimes improve the
source’s intelligibility, while a lower value may give a smoother decay.
