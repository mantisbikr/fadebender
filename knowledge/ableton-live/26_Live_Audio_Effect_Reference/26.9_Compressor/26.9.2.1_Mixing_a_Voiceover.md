# 26.9.2.1 Mixing a Voiceover

Sidechaining is commonly used for so-called ”ducking” effects. For example, imagine that you have
one track containing a voiceover and another track containing background music. Since you want the
voiceover to always be the loudest source in the mix, the background music must get out of the way
every time the narrator is speaking. To do this automatically, insert a Compressor on the music track,
but select the narration track’s output as the external sidechain source.
