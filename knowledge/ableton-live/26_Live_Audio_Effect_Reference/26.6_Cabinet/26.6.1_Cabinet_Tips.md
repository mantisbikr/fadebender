# 26.6.1 Cabinet Tips

Here are some tips for using Cabinet:

26.6.1.1 Amps and Cabinets

Guitar cabinets are normally fed by guitar amps. For this reason, Cabinet is paired with Amp, and the
two are normally used together. But you can also achieve interesting and exotic sounds by using Amp
and Cabinet separately.

26.6.1.2 Multiple mics

A common studio technique is to use multiple mics on a single cabinet, and then adjust the balance
during mixing. This is easy to do by using Live’s Audio Effect Racks. Try this:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Configure one instance of Cabinet as you like.
Put the Cabinet into an Audio Effect Rack.
Duplicate the Rack chain that contains the original Cabinet as many times as you like.
In the additional chains, choose a different Microphone setting and/or mic type.
Adjust the relative volumes of the Rack’s chains in the Rack’s mixer.
