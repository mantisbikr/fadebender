# 26.25.1 Feedback Routing

Looper can be used as both a source and a target for internal routing to other tracks. This allows you
to, for example, create Looper overdubs that continually feed back through another track’s devices. To
set this up:

1.
2.
3.

Insert Looper on a track.
Record at least one pass of material into Looper.
Create another audio track.

4.

5.
6.
7.
8.

In the new track’s top Audio From and Audio To choosers, select the track containing the
Looper.
In the new track’s bottom Audio From and Audio To choosers, select ”Insert-Looper.”
Switch this track’s Monitoring to ”In.”
Add additional effects devices to the device chain of the new track.
Put Looper into Overdub mode.

Looper’s output will now be routed through the other track’s device chain and then back into itself,
creating increasingly processed overdub layers with each pass.
