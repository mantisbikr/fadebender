# 26.25 Looper

The Looper Effect.

Looper is an audio effect based on classic real-time looping devices. It allows you to record and loop
audio, creating endless overdubs that are synced to your Set. If the Set is not playing, Looper can
analyze incoming audio and set Live’s tempo to match it. You can also predefine a loop length before
recording and Live’s tempo will adjust so that your loop fits into the specified number of bars.
Furthermore, audio can be imported to Looper to create a background for newly overdubbed
material, or exported from Looper as a new clip.

The top half of Looper’s interface is a large display area optimized for easy readability during
performance. During recording, the entire display area turns red. After recording, the display shows
the current position in the loop and the total loop length in bars and beats.

Looper’s transport buttons work in a similar way to other transport controls in Live. The Record button
records incoming audio until another button is pressed. This overwrites any audio currently stored in
Looper. Overdub continues to add additional layers of incoming audio that are the length of the

originally recorded material. The Play button plays back the current state of Looper’s buffer without
recording any new material. The Stop button stops playback.

The behavior of the transport controls changes depending on whether or not Live’s playback is
running. With the transport running, Looper behaves like a clip, and is subject to launch quantization
as determined by the Quantization chooser. When Live’s playback is stopped, Looper’s transport
engages immediately, regardless of the Quantization setting.

The Clear button erases Looper’s buffer. If you press Clear in Overdub mode while the transport is
running, the contents of the buffer are cleared but the tempo and length are maintained. Pressing
Clear in any other mode resets the tempo and length.

The Undo button erases everything that you’ve overdubbed since the last time Overdub was enabled.
Your original recording, and anything that was overdubbed in a previous pass, is preserved. After
pressing Undo, the button changes to Redo, which replaces the material removed by the last undo.

The large button below the transport controls is the Multi-Purpose Transport Button. As with the normal
transport buttons, this button’s behavior changes depending on Looper’s current playback state, and
whether or not material has already been recorded. If the buffer is empty, a single click starts
recording. If Looper is recording, overdubbing or stopped, a single click switches to play mode.
During playback, a click switches to overdub mode, allowing you to toggle back and forth between
overdub and playback via additional single clicks.

Quickly pressing the button twice stops Looper, from either play or overdub mode. Clicking and
holding the button for two seconds while in play mode activates Undo or Redo. Pressing and holding
for two seconds while stopped clears Looper’s buffer.

Diagram of Looper’s Multi-Purpose Transport Button Behavior.

Looper’s Multi-Purpose Transport Button is optimized for use with a MIDI footswitch. To assign a
footswitch, enter MIDI Map Mode, click the button and then press your attached footswitch. Then exit
MIDI Map Mode.

The Tempo Control chooser affects how Looper determines the tempo of recorded material:

•
•

•

None: Looper’s internal tempo is independent of Live’s global tempo.
Follow song tempo: The speed of Looper’s playback will be adjusted so that the recorded
material plays back at Live’s global tempo.
Set & Follow song tempo: Live’s global tempo will be adjusted to match the tempo of material
recorded into Looper. Any subsequent changes to Live’s global tempo will adjust the speed of
Looper’s playback so that the recorded material plays back at the new global tempo.

The Record Length chooser is used to set the length of recorded material. Its behavior changes
depending on whether or not Live’s global transport is running and, depending on the setting of the
Tempo Control chooser, can set Live’s global tempo:

•

•

Song running: If Looper’s Record Length chooser is set to the default ”x bars,” Looper will
record until you press another transport button. If you specify a fixed number of bars to record
by selecting another option in the chooser, Looper will record for the specified time and then
switch to Play or Overdub, as determined by the button next to this chooser.
Song not running: If Looper’s Record Length chooser is set to the default ”x bars,” Looper will
make a guess about the tempo of the material you’ve recorded as soon as you press Overdub,
Play or Stop. But this might result in a tempo that’s twice or half as fast as you’d like. If you first
specify a fixed number of bars, Looper’s tempo will adjust so that your recording fits into this
time.

The Song Control chooser determines how Looper’s transport controls will affect Live’s global
transport:

•
•

•

None means that Looper’s transport controls have no effect on Live’s global transport.
Start Song will start Live’s global transport whenever Looper enters Play or Overdub mode.
Looper’s Stop button has no effect on the global transport.
Start & Stop Song locks Live’s global transport to Looper’s transport controls. Entering Play or
Overdub mode will start Live’s transport, while pressing Looper’s Stop button will stop Live’s
transport.

Starting playback of Live’s transport via Looper will automatically adjust the playback position of any
apps that are connected via Ableton Link. This ensures that those apps remain tempo synced, and also
at the correct position in the musical phrase.

The ”×2” button doubles the length of Looper’s recording buffer. Any material that you’ve already
recorded will simply be duplicated. This allows you to, for example, record a series of one-bar ideas,
and then overlay a series of two-bar ideas. The length and tempo of Looper’s buffer is shown in the
display area.

Similarly, the ”÷2” button cuts the length of the current buffer in half. The material in the currently
playing half is kept, while the other half is discarded.

The ”Drag me!” area in the display allows you to export Looper’s buffer as a new audio file. You can
drag and drop to the browser or directly to a track, creating a new clip. The newly created clip’s
Warp Mode will be set to Re-Pitch by default. You can also drag audio files to the ”Drag me!” area,
which will replace the contents of Looper’s buffer. You can then use this material as a bed for further
overdubs, for example.

The Speed knob adjusts Looper’s playback speed (and thus pitch). The up and down arrow buttons to
the left are shortcuts to raise or lower the pitch by octaves (thus doubling or halving the playback
speed). These buttons are subject to the Quantization chooser setting.

Enabling the Reverse button plays the previously recorded material backwards. Any material that you
overdub after enabling Reverse will be played forward. Note that disabling Reverse will then swap
this behavior; the original material will play forward again, while the material that was overdubbed
while Reverse was enabled will play backwards. Engaging the Reverse button is subject to the
Quantization chooser setting.

Feedback sets the amount of previously recorded signal that is fed back into Looper when
overdubbing. When set to 100%, the previously recorded material will never decrease in volume.
When set to 50%, it will be half as loud with each repetition. Any changes to the Feedback amount
won’t take effect until the next repetition. Note that Feedback has no effect in Play mode; each
repetition will be at the same volume.

The Input -> Output chooser provides four options for monitoring Looper’s input:

•

•

•

•

Always allows the input signal to be heard regardless of Looper’s playing or recording state.
You’ll typically want to choose Always when using Looper as an effect in a single track.
Never means that the input signal will never be heard. You’ll typically want to choose Never
when using Looper as an effect in a return track, where it may be fed by send levels from a
variety of other tracks.
Rec/OVR means that the input is only audible when recording or overdubbing, but not when
Looper is in Play mode or stopped. This is useful for situations in which you are feeding audio to
multiple tracks, each containing its own Looper. If each of these Loopers is controlled with its
own foot pedal, you can switch the recording and playback state while playing an instrument,
without having to worry about monitor settings.
Rec/OVR/Stop allows the input signal to be heard except when Looper is in play mode. This is
similar to Beat Repeat’s Insert mode, and can be used to record material that can suddenly
interrupt your live playing.

26.25.1 Feedback Routing

Looper can be used as both a source and a target for internal routing to other tracks. This allows you
to, for example, create Looper overdubs that continually feed back through another track’s devices. To
set this up:

1.
2.
3.

Insert Looper on a track.
Record at least one pass of material into Looper.
Create another audio track.

4.

5.
6.
7.
8.

In the new track’s top Audio From and Audio To choosers, select the track containing the
Looper.
In the new track’s bottom Audio From and Audio To choosers, select ”Insert-Looper.”
Switch this track’s Monitoring to ”In.”
Add additional effects devices to the device chain of the new track.
Put Looper into Overdub mode.

Looper’s output will now be routed through the other track’s device chain and then back into itself,
creating increasingly processed overdub layers with each pass.
