# 26.14.4 Global Controls

The Reverb knob sets the amount of reverb added, and you use the Reverb Location chooser to set
where the reverb is added in the processing chain: pre delay, post delay, or within the feedback loop.
Use the Decay slider to lengthen or shorten the reverb tail.

The Stereo control sets the stereo width of the wet signal. 0% yields a mono signal whereas values
above 100% create a widened stereo panorama.

The Output sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal. The Dry/Wet control adjusts the
balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100 percent when using Echo in a return
track. The Dry/Wet parameter’s context menu lets you toggle Equal-Loudness. When enabled, a
50/50 mix will sound equally loud for most signals.
