# 26.14 Echo

The Echo Effect.

Echo is a modulation delay effect that lets you set the delay time on two independent delay lines,
while giving you control over envelope and filter modulation.

The Channel Mode buttons let you choose between three different modes: Stereo, Ping Pong and
Mid/Side.

The Left and Right delay line controls let you choose the delay time, which can be set in beat divisions
or milliseconds, depending on the state of the Sync switch. Note that when the Mid/Side channel
mode is selected, the Left and Right delay line controls are replaced with Mid and Side knobs.

You can use the Sync Mode choosers to select one of the following beat-synced modes: Notes,
Triplet, Dotted and 16th. Note that when switching between Sync Modes, the resulting changes are
only audible while the Sync switch is set to Sync.

When Stereo Link is engaged, changing either channel’s delay line control, Sync switch or Sync
Mode settings will apply the changes to both sides.

Changing the Delay Offset sliders shortens or extends the delay time by fractional amounts, thus
producing the ”swing” type of timing effect found in drum machines. Note that when Stereo Link is
enabled, the Delay Offset can still be adjusted individually for the two delay lines.

The Input knob sets the amount of gain applied to the dry signal. To apply distortion to the dry signal,
press the “D” button.

The Feedback parameter defines how much of each channel’s output signal feeds back into the delay
lines’ inputs. The “Ø“ button inverts each channel’s output signal before adding it back to their inputs.

26.14.1 Echo Tab

The Echo tab provides a visualization and control of the delay lines and filter parameters.

Echo’s Tunnel Visualization.

The Echo Tunnel’s circular lines represent the individual repeats, progressing from the outside of the
tunnel to its center. The distance between the lines indicates the time between the repeats, and the
white dots in the middle form a fixed 1/8th note grid for reference. You can adjust the delay times for
each delay line by clicking and dragging in the display.

Echo’s Filter.

The Filter toggle enables a high-pass and low-pass filter. The HP slider adjusts the cutoff frequency of
the high-pass filter and the adjacent Res slider adjusts the high-pass filter’s resonance. The LP slider
adjusts the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter, and you can use the Res slider on the right side to
adjust the low-pass filter’s resonance.

The Filter Display makes it possible to visualize the filter curves. To show or hide the Filter Display, use
the triangular toggle button. You can also adjust the filter parameters by clicking and dragging either
of the filter dots in the Filter Display.

26.14.2 Modulation Tab

Echo’s Modulation tab contains an LFO that modulates filter frequency and delay time, and an
envelope follower that can be blended with the LFO.

Echo’s Modulation Tab.

You can choose from one of six different modulation waveforms including sine, triangle, sawtooth up,
sawtooth down, square, and noise. The selected waveform will appear in the display, which you can
drag to adjust the modulation frequency.

When Sync is enabled, modulation is synchronized to the song tempo. You can use the Rate slider to
set the frequency of the modulation oscillator in beat divisions. When Sync is disabled, you can use
the Freq slider to adjust frequency of the modulation oscillator in Hertz.

Phase adjusts the amount of offset between the waveforms for the left and right channel. At 180°, the
channels will be perfectly out of phase.

Mod Delay adjusts the amount of modulation that is applied to the delay time. Modulation x4 scales
the delay time modulation depth by a factor of four. With short delay times, this produces deep
flanging sounds.

Mod Filter adjusts the amount of modulation that is applied to the filter.

Env Mix blends between the modulation oscillator and an envelope follower. At 100%, only the
envelope’s modulation will be heard. At 0%, only the LFO’s modulation will be heard.

26.14.3 Character Tab

Echo’s Character tab contains parameters that control dynamics and add imperfections to your sound.

Echo’s Character Tab.

Gate enables a gate at Echo’s input. It mutes the signal components below its threshold. Threshold sets
the threshold level that incoming audio signals must exceed in order to open the gate. Release sets
how long it takes for the gate to close after the signal has dropped below the threshold.

When Ducking is enabled, the wet signal is proportionally reduced as long as there is an input signal.
Ducking begins to affect the output signal when the input level exceeds the set Threshold. Release sets
how long it takes for ducking to stop after the input signal drops below the threshold.

When enabled, Noise introduces noise to simulate the character of vintage equipment. You can adjust
the Amount of noise added to the signal, and Morph between different types of noise.

When enabled, Wobble adds an irregular modulation of the delay time to simulate tape delays. You
can adjust the Amount of wobble added to the signal, and Morph between different types of wobble
modulation.

Repitch causes a pitch variation when changing the delay time, similar to the behavior of hardware
delay units. When Repitch is disabled, changing the delay time creates a crossfade between the old
and new delay times.

Note that in order to save CPU, the Echo device turns itself off at least eight seconds after its input
stops producing sound. However, Echo will not switch off if both the Noise and Gate parameters are
enabled.

26.14.4 Global Controls

The Reverb knob sets the amount of reverb added, and you use the Reverb Location chooser to set
where the reverb is added in the processing chain: pre delay, post delay, or within the feedback loop.
Use the Decay slider to lengthen or shorten the reverb tail.

The Stereo control sets the stereo width of the wet signal. 0% yields a mono signal whereas values
above 100% create a widened stereo panorama.

The Output sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal. The Dry/Wet control adjusts the
balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100 percent when using Echo in a return
track. The Dry/Wet parameter’s context menu lets you toggle Equal-Loudness. When enabled, a
50/50 mix will sound equally loud for most signals.

### Signal Flow Overview

The internal signal flow is documented by the manual’s subsections for this device. The order of the subsections below reflects the device’s functional stages where applicable.

> No explicit parameter ranges or types were identified in the text of this section, so this table is intentionally minimal.

_No explicit dependency statements were found in the text of this section._

### Enable / Unlock Conditions

See the quoted conditions above. If a control is described as active/visible only when another parameter is enabled, it will appear in the list above.

See the quoted conditions above. If the manual states that a control has no audible effect unless another control is enabled or set to a certain mode, it is captured above.

### Parameter Interaction Notes (Non-Aesthetic)

Purely functional interactions noted in the manual are included in the quoted conditions. No aesthetic mixing guidance is added here.
