# 26.14.2 Modulation Tab

Echo’s Modulation tab contains an LFO that modulates filter frequency and delay time, and an
envelope follower that can be blended with the LFO.

Echo’s Modulation Tab.

You can choose from one of six different modulation waveforms including sine, triangle, sawtooth up,
sawtooth down, square, and noise. The selected waveform will appear in the display, which you can
drag to adjust the modulation frequency.

When Sync is enabled, modulation is synchronized to the song tempo. You can use the Rate slider to
set the frequency of the modulation oscillator in beat divisions. When Sync is disabled, you can use
the Freq slider to adjust frequency of the modulation oscillator in Hertz.

Phase adjusts the amount of offset between the waveforms for the left and right channel. At 180°, the
channels will be perfectly out of phase.

Mod Delay adjusts the amount of modulation that is applied to the delay time. Modulation x4 scales
the delay time modulation depth by a factor of four. With short delay times, this produces deep
flanging sounds.

Mod Filter adjusts the amount of modulation that is applied to the filter.

Env Mix blends between the modulation oscillator and an envelope follower. At 100%, only the
envelope’s modulation will be heard. At 0%, only the LFO’s modulation will be heard.
