# 26.14.1 Echo Tab

The Echo tab provides a visualization and control of the delay lines and filter parameters.

Echo’s Tunnel Visualization.

The Echo Tunnel’s circular lines represent the individual repeats, progressing from the outside of the
tunnel to its center. The distance between the lines indicates the time between the repeats, and the
white dots in the middle form a fixed 1/8th note grid for reference. You can adjust the delay times for
each delay line by clicking and dragging in the display.

Echo’s Filter.

The Filter toggle enables a high-pass and low-pass filter. The HP slider adjusts the cutoff frequency of
the high-pass filter and the adjacent Res slider adjusts the high-pass filter’s resonance. The LP slider
adjusts the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter, and you can use the Res slider on the right side to
adjust the low-pass filter’s resonance.

The Filter Display makes it possible to visualize the filter curves. To show or hide the Filter Display, use
the triangular toggle button. You can also adjust the filter parameters by clicking and dragging either
of the filter dots in the Filter Display.
