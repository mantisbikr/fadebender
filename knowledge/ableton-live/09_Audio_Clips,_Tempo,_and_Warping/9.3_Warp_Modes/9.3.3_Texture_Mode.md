# 9.3.3 Texture Mode

Texture mode works well for sounds that don’t have a clear melody or pitch, such as polyphonic
orchestral music, atmospheric pads, noise, or drones. It’s also great for sound design and
experimental audio manipulation.

The Grain Size control determines the grain size used, but unlike in Tones mode, the audio’s tonal
characteristics are not taken into consideration when the grain size is adjusted.

Fluctuation introduces randomness into how the sample is processed. Higher values result in more
random variation.

9.3.4 Re-Pitch Mode

Re-Pitch mode can be used to adjust the sample’s playback rate. This lets you change the pitch of the
sample while modifying its tempo, similar to how DJs change the playback speed on turntables, or
how old samplers change the pitch of samples when sped up or slowed down. For example, if you
double the speed, the pitch goes up by an octave.

In this mode, the sample’s transposition controls are deactivated because changing the playback
speed directly affects the pitch.
