# 9.3.2 Tones Mode

Tones mode is useful for stretching audio that has a distinct pitch, such as vocals, monophonic
instruments, and basslines.

Grain Size lets you roughly adjust the average size of the grains used. The actual grain size is
determined by the clarity of pitch changes in the audio. Small grain sizes work best for audio that has
distinct pitch variations. Using larger grain sizes can help prevent unwanted noise but may also cause
audible artifacts.
