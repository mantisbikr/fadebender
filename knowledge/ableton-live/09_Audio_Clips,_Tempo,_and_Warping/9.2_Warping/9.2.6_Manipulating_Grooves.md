# 9.2.6 Manipulating Grooves

While Warp Markers can be used to accurately sync the musical timing in a sample, they can also be
used to deliberately alter the rhythm for creative effects.

For example, if you notice that a transient in a percussive sample comes late, simply pin a Warp
Marker to it and then drag the marker to align it with the correct beat. You may want to pin the
adjacent transients as well, to avoid affecting neighboring regions in the sample.

Using Warp Markers to Manipulate the Groove.

Altering a sample’s natural rhythm using Warp Markers is an interesting creative technique,
particularly when used together with grooves.
