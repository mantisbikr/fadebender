# 9.2.7 Quantizing Audio

In addition to using Warp Markers to time-stretch a sample, you can also automatically snap a
waveform to the grid using quantization. Quantization aligns the audio by moving the nearest
transient to the closest grid line.

To quantize audio, click anywhere in the Sample Editor to bring it into focus, and then use the
Quantize command from the Edit menu or the shortcut Ctrl
options align the audio based on the current quantization settings, which can be adjusted via the
Quantize panel.

Audio can be quantized to match the current grid size or a specific grid division, including triplets. To
achieve a more subtle result, use the Amount control to adjust the level of applied quantization. This
control shifts the Warp Markers by a percentage of the chosen quantization value.
