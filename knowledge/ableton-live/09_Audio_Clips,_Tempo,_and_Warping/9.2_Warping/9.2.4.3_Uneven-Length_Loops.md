# 9.2.4.3 Uneven-Length Loops

Samples that have not been edited for seamless looping or have no distinct beat pattern will also play
out of sync.

You can correct this by moving the insert marker to the first downbeat in the sample and then using the
Set 1.1.1 Here context menu option to place a Warp Marker there.

Use the Set 1.1.1 Here Command to Place the First Warp Marker.

Once the first Warp Marker is set, you can then use the Warp From Here context menu option. To
eliminate extra silence at the end of the loop, you can place a Warp Marker before the silent portion
of the sample.
