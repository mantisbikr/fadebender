# 9.2.4.2 Odd-Length Loops

Samples that have an odd number of bars will play out of sync as Live will initially assume that the
loop contains an even number of bars due to the default 4/4 time signature setting.

For synced playback, a Warp Marker at the end of the sample needs to be placed at the beginning
of an even bar, for example, bar eight in a nine-bar loop. To fix this, simply add a marker to the
correct bar.

Additionally, Live may assume that some loops with odd bars are longer or shorter than they actually
are, e.g., a nine-bar loop may be mistaken for an eight-bar loop. In this case, the last bar may not be
visible initially. To fix this, you can drag a Warp Marker at the end of the sample toward the right until
the eighth bar becomes visible.
