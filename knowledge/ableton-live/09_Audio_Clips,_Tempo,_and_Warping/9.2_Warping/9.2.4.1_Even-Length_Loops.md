# 9.2.4.1 Even-Length Loops

When you import a sample, Live assumes that it contains a well-cut musical loop of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16
bars in length, and sets the tempo accordingly. Additionally, two Warp Markers are created: one at
the start of the sample and one at the end.

A Four-Bar Loop in the Sample Editor.

The sample’s estimated tempo is shown in the BPM field of the Audio Utilities panel. If you know the
exact BPM, you can type it into the field. If you’re not sure of the precise tempo, you can hold Shift
while dragging in the slider to adjust the BPM in fine increments. You can also hold Shift and drag
from the clip’s edge in Arrangement View to stretch or compress the clip’s tempo.

The BPM Field in the Audio Utilities Panel.

Sometimes the estimation of the original tempo is incorrect, and the BPM field may show a tempo that
is either twice as fast or half as slow. You can correct this by using the ×2 and ÷2 buttons to double or
halve the tempo, respectively.
