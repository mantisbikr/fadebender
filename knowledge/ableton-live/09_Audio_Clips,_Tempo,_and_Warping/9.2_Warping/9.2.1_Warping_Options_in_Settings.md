# 9.2.1 Warping Options in Settings

In addition to using the Warp switch to enable warping in individual clips, you can also configure the
warping behavior for samples when they are loaded via the Record, Warp & Launch Settings. When
a sample is first imported, Live will decide whether it is short or long, and will then apply one of the
options described below.

The Loop/Warp Short Samples option lets you choose the default warping state for short samples:

•
•
•
•

Unwarped One Shot - Samples will not be warped when loaded.
Warped One Shot - Samples will be warped based on the default Warp Mode but not looped.
Warped Loop - Samples will be warped and looped.
Auto - Live will automatically apply one of the above options based on what would work best
for the specific sample. This option is selected by default.

The Auto-Warp Long Samples option you choose whether long samples are automatically warped
when loaded or not. This option is enabled by default. A Warp Marker will be added to the first beat
for each bar once the sample is auto-warped. If this option is switched off, long samples will be
unwarped when they are added to tracks.

The Default Warp Mode option lets you set which Warp Mode is automatically applied to samples
when they are warped. The Warp Mode defines the algorithm used for time-stretching the audio,
which affects the clip’s sound. Beats mode is initially set as the default Warp Mode.
