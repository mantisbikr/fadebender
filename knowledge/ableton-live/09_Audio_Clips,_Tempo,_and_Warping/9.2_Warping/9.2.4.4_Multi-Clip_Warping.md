# 9.2.4.4 Multi-Clip Warping

When you select multiple clips that are of the same length and then add or adjust Warp Markers to
one of them, those changes will automatically apply to all the selected clips. This feature is particularly
useful when you have several clips with the same rhythm and want to alter the timing uniformly. For
example, if you have a recorded multitrack performance and want to correct any timing issues across
all tracks.
