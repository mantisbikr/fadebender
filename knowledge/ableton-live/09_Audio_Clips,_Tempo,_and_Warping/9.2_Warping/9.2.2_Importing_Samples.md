# 9.2.2 Importing Samples

You can drag samples into a Set from folders on your computer, or you can use the Import Audio
File… command in the Create menu when an audio track is selected to import MP3, AAC, Ogg
Vorbis, Ogg FLAC, or FLAC files. When using this command, files are added at the insert marker in the
Arrangement View or inserted into the selected clip slot in the Session View.

When a file is imported into Live for the first time, it is analyzed and cannot be played or edited until
the analysis process is complete. Once analyzed, the sample will be accessible in the Sample Editor,
and in most cases, synced with the Set’s tempo.
