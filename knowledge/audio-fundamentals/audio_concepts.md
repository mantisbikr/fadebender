# Audio Engineering Concepts (Concise)

## Gain Staging & Metering
- Keep peaks around -6 to -12 dBFS on individual tracks for headroom.
- Use meters: Peak for transients, RMS/LUFS for perceived loudness.
- Avoid clipping into plugins; lower input, compensate with output gain.

## EQ Basics
- Cut before boost; remove muddiness 150–350 Hz on many sources.
- High-pass filter non-bass elements to reduce low-end buildup.
- Tame harshness 2–5 kHz; add presence 3–6 kHz sparingly.
- Narrow cuts for issues; broader boosts for tone.

## Compression
- Threshold controls when compression starts; ratio controls how much.
- Attack: slower lets transients through; faster tames transients.
- Release: faster restores dynamics; slower smooths.
- Aim for 2–6 dB gain reduction for gentle control; use parallel for punch.

## Reverb & Delay
- Use sends for spatial effects; keep inserts for special cases.
- Pre-delay separates source from tail; longer pre-delay = clearer vocals.
- Short decay for small spaces; longer for ambience—watch build-up.
- Delay times synced to tempo; feedback controls repeats density.

## Stereo Field
- Pan to create space; center key elements (kick, bass, lead vocal).
- Use M/S EQ to widen highs cautiously; check mono compatibility.

## Loudness & Limiting
- Leave headroom on mix bus (~-6 dBFS peak) before mastering.
- Limiters catch peaks; don’t over-limit—listen for pumping/distortion.
