The filtered repeats have a distinct 'telephonic' or 'old radio' character due to the filter being centered around 1.7 kHz.",
          "why": "The bandpass filter (centered at 1.7 kHz with moderate width) is the core element, shaping the repeats to sound distinct, lo-fi, or 'telephonic' by cutting out low rumble and harsh highs. The highly asymmetrical delay times (left ~3/16th note, right near zero) create an unbalanced stereo effect, making the rhythmic, filtered repeat predominantly audible on the left, which is further enforced by both channels being tempo-synced. Moderate feedback (58.17%) ensures multiple, noticeable repeats, while the 33% dry/wet mix allows the effect to blend well without overwhelming the dry signal.",

While `Dry/Wet` is 100% (suggesting a send setup), this extreme decay time will completely dominate the mix, obscuring dry signals and creating an overwhelming wash.

          "what": "An extremely large, bright, and highly diffused hall reverb, optimized for send/return tracks. It features a long pre-delay and medium-long decay, combined with maximum room size and diffusion, creating a vast, smooth, and expansive sound. Input filtering is bypassed, ensuring full-spectrum richness, while the low-shelf gently tames low frequencies in the tail for clarity. Subtle modulation is applied to both early reflections and the main tail for added movement and lushness.",
          "why": "This preset excels at crafting an immense and pristine sense of space due to its maximum room size, long pre-delay (30ms), and 2-second decay. The un-filtered input and the high-shelf at 16kHz maintain brightness, while the attenuated low-shelf (at 173Hz) ensures the vast tail remains clean and free from muddiness. Maximum diffusion and density create an exceptionally smooth, dense tail, further enhanced by subtle ER spin and chorus modulation for a lush, evolving texture. The higher diffuse level over early reflections, combined with a wide stereo image, contributes to an enveloping and distant feel, perfect for adding depth and atmosphere to elements meant to reside in a grand, ethereal environment. Configured for 100% wet, it's ideal for use on a send track to blend this rich ambiance into various sources.",

The extremely long `Decay Time` (5.0s) means any frequencies will sustain for a considerable duration. Crucially, the `In LowCut On` is `0.0` (off) and `LowShelf On` is `0.0` (off), meaning there's **no low-frequency filtering or damping** at the input or in the tail. This will cause low-end frequencies to accumulate, leading to muddiness and boom. Additionally, a positive `HiShelf Gain` (0.40) at `HiFilter Freq` 5373.20 suggests highs above ~5.3kHz are sustained or even boosted, risking harshness or sizzle over time.",
          "cpu_usage": "This preset combines a very long `Decay Time` (5.0s), a very large `Room Size` (180), and the highest `Density` setting (3.0). These parameters indicate a complex, resource-intensive calculation, which will result in **high CPU usage**. Consider if such a large, dense reverb is essential for your track.",
          "low_end_accumulation": "This preset has a high probability of **significant low-end accumulation** due to two critical factors: The `In LowCut On` parameter is `0.0` (off), allowing all low frequencies to enter the reverb engine unchecked. Concurrently, the `LowShelf On` parameter is also `0.0` (off), providing **no low-frequency damping or reduction within the reverb tail**. Combined with the extremely long `Decay Time` (5.0s), any low-frequency content in your input will sustain for a very long period, quickly leading to a muddy, boomy, and overwhelming low end in the mix.",
          "mono_compatibility": "The `Stereo Image` is set to `100.00`, creating a very wide stereo field. This extensive width can lead to significant phase cancellation and a collapsed, thin, or muddy sound when played back in mono. Always check your mix in mono.",
          "mix_context": "With a `Dry/Wet` setting of `100.03`, this reverb is intended for a **send/return track**; using it as an insert will completely remove the dry signal. The extremely long `Decay Time` (5.0s) and large `Room Size` (180) are designed for a vast, ambient space (a 'Cathedral'), which will likely **dominate your mix**. The `Pre-Delay` of 60ms is unusually long (outside the natural range of 1-25ms) and might make the dry source sound disconnected from the reverb. Furthermore, the low `Diffusion` (19.83) could result in a somewhat metallic or grainy texture in the tail, which may not suit all sources."

We also lower the `In Filter Freq` (the high-cut point of the input filter, since `In HighCut On` is active) to reduce harsh highs before they enter the reverb engine, preventing 'harsh/sizzly tail' issues.

Increasing `Pre-Delay` further separates the source from the reverb, enhancing the sense of a vast space. Reducing `Diffusion` makes the tail less smooth and potentially more grainy or fluttery, contributing to a less defined, 'looser' texture.

          "what": "A vast, expansive reverb preset named 'Concert Hall' that emphasizes a long, smooth, and highly diffuse tail with significant separation from the dry signal, and notably, virtually no early reflections.",
          "why": "This preset's core characteristic is its exceptionally long pre-delay (50ms) combined with a Reflect Level of -0.00 (effectively zero early reflections). This configuration ensures maximum clarity and upfront presence for the dry signal, as the reverb only begins after a significant delay and without any initial spatial cues. The long decay (2.4s), large room size, and high density create a smooth, rich, and immersive wash, hinting at a vast space. Input high-cut prevents harshness from exciting the reverb engine, while a subtle high-shelf boost on the tail maintains some brightness. The subtle chorus adds a gentle, non-static movement to the tail, preventing metallic ringing. It's designed for a powerful, clean, and distinctly *behind-the-source* ambient effect, rather than a natural, upfront room simulation.",

            "Cinematic sound design for establishing massive, distant environments or dramatic, swelling ambience.",

Furthermore, the 'HiShelf Gain' is positive (0.67) at 'HiFilter Freq' (3820.39 Hz), which may cause the reverb tail to be overly bright or harsh if not carefully managed by input high-cut filters.",

This, combined with the long 'Decay Time' (2.4 seconds), will cause a significant accumulation of low-end energy, likely resulting in a muddy and uncontrolled low frequency response in the reverb tail.",
          "mono_compatibility": "The 'Stereo Image' is set to a very wide 100.00. Check the mix carefully in mono to ensure no significant phase cancellation or loss of elements, as extremely wide stereo reverbs can sometimes cause issues in mono playback.",

Using it as an insert effect will completely replace the dry signal with reverb. Additionally, the 'Reflect Level' is effectively muted (-0.00), meaning there will be no early reflections. This, combined with the very long 'Pre-Delay' (50.01 ms), will create a diffuse, detached reverb wash that pushes the source very far back, rather than a natural, immediate sense of a concert hall space."

This, combined with a relatively long 'Decay Time' of 2.3 seconds, creates a high risk of the low end building up and muddying the mix. The very small 'Room Size' could exacerbate this by creating undesirable low-frequency resonances.",

Using it as an insert effect will result in a completely wet signal with no dry sound. The 'In HighCut On' with 'In Filter Freq' at 1.18 kHz is an extremely aggressive input high-cut, making the reverb sound very dark or muffled; most high-frequency content from the source will be filtered out before hitting the reverb engine. The combination of an extremely small 'Room Size' (0.67) and maximum 'Scale' (100.00) will likely result in a highly colored, artificial, and potentially metallic-sounding reverb, as noted in the KB for small sizes and high scale.",

          "what": "A vast, immense, and dark hall reverb, characterized by an exceptionally long decay and room size. It features a significant pre-delay to separate the dry signal and enhance the perception of distance, while an active input high-cut filter contributes to its 'dark' tonality by pre-filtering brighter frequencies. The reverb tail is smooth and dense with a wide stereo image, lacking any modulation from chorus or ER spin, resulting in a static, deeply atmospheric, and somewhat mysterious space.",
          "why": "To evoke a sense of immense, distant, and unmodulated space with a distinctly dark tonal character. The long pre-delay (36.52ms) and massive room size (156.07) ensure a feeling of vast scale and separation, while the very long decay (3.97s) allows the reverb to sustain and envelop. The input high-cut filter (In HighCut On: 1.0) is crucial for the 'Dark Hall' aesthetic, preventing harsh high frequencies from over-exciting the reverb and ensuring a deep, non-sibilant, and muted atmosphere, ideal for creating a profound, solemn, or ethereal sonic depth as a 100% wet send effect.",

          "what": "A fully wet, medium-decay reverb simulating a moderately sized room with a distinctive dark, smooth, and warm character. It features an aggressive high-cut on the input signal (around 1.2kHz) to intentionally darken the reflections, while the reverb tail itself is dense and smooth, with a subtle high-shelf lift and a noticeable low-shelf boost for added body and warmth. The low global 'Density' setting might contribute to a less pristine or slightly grittier texture despite high diffusion.",
          "why": "This preset is designed to create a deep, immersive space with a deliberately dark tonal quality, achieved by pre-filtering high frequencies before they even hit the reverb engine. The combination of a relatively long decay, moderate room size, smooth diffusion, and warmth-inducing low-shelf boost allows for a lush tail that doesn't become harsh or muddy, making it ideal for adding character and depth to sources that benefit from a less bright, more colored spatial effect. Being fully wet, it's tailored for use on a send/return track, providing a dedicated ambient layer.",

            "Vocals: For a moody, distant, or vintage vocal effect, where clarity is desired without harsh highs.",
