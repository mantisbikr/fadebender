# Fadebender

**Fadebender** is an intelligent NLP-driven conductor for your DAW that provides expert-level audio engineering advice through natural conversation.

It lets you type commands like:
- "I want spaciousness to my vocals" â†’ ChromaVerb Synth Hall preset recommendations
- "add punch to my drums" â†’ Multipressor settings with professional compression ratios
- "set track one volume to minus six dB" â†’ Direct parameter control
- "go back to how track 2 sounded 5 minutes ago" â†’ Complete version control

**Current Status (Sept 14, 2024)**: Core architecture and professional knowledge base complete. Intent execution pipeline needs debugging.

Fadebender transforms natural language into professional mixing workflows, making advanced audio engineering techniques accessible through conversation.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- **MVP v0.1 (Ableton-only):**
  Add state-aware control using Ableton Remote Scripts (Python API) and a UDP bridge. Control a single track volume and one device parameter end-to-end.

---

## ðŸ›  Quickstart

1. Run NLP Service
   ```bash
   cd nlp-service
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

2. Run Master Controller
   ```bash
   cd ../master-controller
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Run Bridge
   - Open `native-bridge-mac/BridgeApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
   - Run â†’ creates virtual MIDI port "Fadebender Out".

4. In Ableton
   - Load the Remote Script and ensure the UDP bridge is running.
   - Confirm you can ping the script from the server and move Track 1 volume via API.

## ðŸ“˜ User Onboarding

- For nonâ€‘technical users and future cloud releases, see `docs/USER_ONBOARDING.md`.
- To install the Ableton Remote Script manually during development, see `docs/ABLETON_SETUP.md`.

---

## Developer Setup

- Read the scaffold and acceptance criteria in `docs/Fadebender_Codex_Handoff.md`.
- The roadmap is in `docs/roadmap.md` (copied from `Fadebender_MVP.md`).
