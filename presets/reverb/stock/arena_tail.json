    "what": "Large hall reverb with extended decay (4+ seconds) and bright, spacious character designed for dramatic impact",
    "when": [
      "lead vocals in arena rock or stadium anthems",
      "electric guitar solos requiring epic space",
      "synth leads in EDM builds and drops",
      "dramatic ballad vocals",
      "cinematic moments requiring large-scale ambience"
    ],
    "why": "Long decay time (4.0-4.5s) creates the perception of a massive enclosed space like an arena or concert hall. Bright high-frequency shelf (+2dB @ 7kHz) adds air and excitement, mimicking the reflective surfaces of large venues. Wide stereo image (110-120°) maximizes spaciousness and envelopment. Moderate predelay (20-25ms) maintains source clarity while establishing natural distance cues consistent with large room acoustics."

    "frequency_buildup": "Bright high shelf (+2dB @ 7kHz) can emphasize vocal sibilance (5-8kHz) and cymbal wash. Use de-esser before send or reduce high shelf if tail becomes harsh.",
